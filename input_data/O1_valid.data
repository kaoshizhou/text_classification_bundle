a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad .

whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck .

davis ... gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft ally mcbeal-style fantasy sequences . 
bittersweet comedy\/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable italian guys . 
i hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness . 
the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation . 
a smart , provocative drama that does the nearly impossible : it gets under the skin of a man we only know as an evil , monstrous lunatic . 
throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ?

it 's still terrible ! 
a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller . 
but ... in trying to capture the novel 's deeper intimate resonances , the film has -- ironically - distanced us from the characters .

fun and nimble . 
fifty years after the fact , the world 's political situation seems little different , and -lrb- director phillip -rrb- noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill . 
though a capable thriller , somewhere along the way k-19 jettisoned some crucial drama . 
turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters 
manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting . 
an action\/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of day of the jackal , the french connection , and heat . 
an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .

an empty , purposeless exercise . 
cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment ... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience .

an important movie , a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values .

soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film . 
it inspires a continuing and deeply satisfying awareness of the best movies as monumental ` picture shows . '

a chronicle not only of one man 's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign 's end , an extended publicity department . 
the performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye . 
a vibrant , colorful , semimusical rendition . 
it 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . 
even if you do n't think -lrb- kissinger 's -rrb- any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he 'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch .

a sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work . 
there 's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of birthday girl . 
though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
it is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film . 
everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . 
visually , ` santa clause 2 ' is wondrously creative . 
he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither .

it strikes hardest ... when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . 
theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun . 
a vivid , spicy footnote to history , and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish . 
it 's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip . 
it 's a cool event for the whole family . 
smart , provocative and blisteringly funny .

a very well-made , funny and entertaining picture . 
sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers ' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .

go , girls , right down the reality drain . 
forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
clare peploe 's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence . 
what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip . 
shame on writer\/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull . 
a riveting story well told . 
most thrillers send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments ; `` frailty '' leaves us with the terrifying message that the real horror may be waiting for us at home . 
i just loved every minute of this film . 
no cute factor here ... not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away . 
features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film . 
it 's burns ' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown . 
an example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship . 
its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary . 
a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being . 
like the hanks character , he 's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed . 
it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 
bad and baffling from the get-go . 
but once the falcon arrives in the skies above manhattan , the adventure is on red alert . 
ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would . 
the film 's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence . 
alternative medicine obviously has its merits ... but ayurveda does the field no favors . 
such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you ca n't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 
it 's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter . 
an inventive , absorbing movie that 's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist . 
a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 
a burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at . 
in addition to gluing you to the edge of your seat , changing lanes is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight . 
if you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy . 
an honest , sensitive story from a vietnamese point of view . 
the byplay and bickering between the now spy-savvy siblings , carmen -lrb- vega -rrb- and juni -lrb- sabara -rrb- cortez , anchor the film in a very real and amusing give-and-take . 
both lead performances are oscar-size . 
makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
the movie 's relatively simple plot and uncomplicated morality play well with the affable cast . 
what 's infuriating about full frontal is that it 's too close to real life to make sense . 
it 's fun , but it 's a real howler . 
told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . 
it 's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments . 
loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
schaeffer is n't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does . 
as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
this is an action movie with an action icon who 's been all but decommissioned . 
it 's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between chaplin and kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming . 
a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
griffiths proves she 's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession . 
though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 
the movie is well crafted , and well executed . 
his -lrb- nelson 's -rrb- screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward . 
looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito 's way . 
i 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
horns and halos benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth . 
a great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar . 
not everyone will welcome or accept the trials of henry kissinger as faithful portraiture , but few can argue that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one . 
possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio . 
an extremely funny , ultimately heartbreaking look at life in contemporary china . 
if you answered yes , by all means enjoy the new guy . 
if you like blood , guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though ... you will likely enjoy this monster . 
the journey to the secret 's eventual discovery is a separate adventure , and thrill enough . 
the 3-d vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry . 
this is a film living far too much in its own head . 
humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling ... recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly . 
although it tries to be much more , it 's really just another major league . 
i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects . 
it is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias , especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise . 
i 'm guessing the director is a magician . 
the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 
too much power , not enough puff . 
this bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better . 
an infuriating film . 
but it 's surprisingly harmless . 
an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he 'd gone the way of don simpson . 
though in some ways similar to catherine breillat 's fat girl , rain is the far superior film . 
a movie i loved on first sight and , even more important , love in remembrance . 
there 's an energy to y tu mamá también . 
-lrb- `` take care of my cat '' -rrb- is an honestly nice little film that takes us on an examination of young adult life in urban south korea through the hearts and minds of the five principals . 
has a certain ghoulish fascination , and generates a fair amount of b-movie excitement . 
the success of undercover brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally . 
unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes . 
most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . 
in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation . 
-lrb- næs -rrb- directed the stage version of elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage . 
does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
the script kicks in , and mr. hartley 's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow . 
it confirms fincher 's status as a film maker who artfully bends technical know-how to the service of psychological insight . 
the direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority , and the performances by harris , phifer and cam ` ron seal the deal . 
it is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished . 
the year 's greatest adventure , and jackson 's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate . 
a full experience , a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence . 
naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation . 
ultimately , `` mib ii '' succeeds due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it ca n't be dismissed as mindless . 
this is standard crime drama fare ... instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
escaping the studio , piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie . 
an indispensable peek at the art and the agony of making people laugh . 
borrows a bit from the classics `` wait until dark '' and `` extremities '' ... but in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself . 
no screen fantasy-adventure in recent memory has the showmanship of clones ' last 45 minutes . 
the film is all over the place , really . 
formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 
there are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit . 
while general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music , they 'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds . 
sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . 
white oleander may leave you rolling your eyes in the dark , but that does n't mean you wo n't like looking at it . 
... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` queen '' and less of the `` damned . '' 
it 's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend . 
it 's not a motion picture ; it 's an utterly static picture . 
that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year 's worst cinematic tragedies . 
-lrb- has -rrb- an immediacy and an intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it 's all true . 
and educational ! 
a real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant . 
, is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly . 
her fans walked out muttering words like `` horrible '' and `` terrible , '' but had so much fun dissing the film that they did n't mind the ticket cost . 
this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
a wry , affectionate delight . 
we root for -lrb- clara and paul -rrb- , even like them , though perhaps it 's an emotion closer to pity . 
for more than two decades mr. nachtwey has traveled to places in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity . 
provides the kind of ` laugh therapy ' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending . 
all three actresses are simply dazzling , particularly balk , who 's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents . 
a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . 
a film that loses sight of its own story . 
you need n't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of haynes ' work . 
it 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that . 
mike leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life 
skins has a desolate air , but eyre , a native american raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor . 
strange it is , but delightfully so . 
an original and highly cerebral examination of the psychopathic mind 
a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming . 
this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work . 
i ca n't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
pompous and garbled . 
becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
this story still seems timely and important . 
what 's surprising about full frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you . 
richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold . 
this time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it 's still a rollicking good time for the most part . 
there 's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
although fairly involving as far as it goes , the film does n't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything . 
the writing is clever and the cast is appealing . 
but they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail . 
a difficult , absorbing film that manages to convey more substance despite its repetitions and inconsistencies than do most films than are far more pointed and clear . 
could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? 
the otherwise good-naturedness of mr. deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less - than-likely new york celebrities ... certainly raises the film above anything sandler 's been attached to before . 
overall very good for what it 's trying to do . 
especially give credit to affleck . 
a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
a tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty . 
what redeems the film is the cast , particularly the ya-yas themselves . 
the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
a mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in . 
the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances . 
... works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once . 
a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids ' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder 
if hill is n't quite his generation 's don siegel -lrb- or robert aldrich -rrb- , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and cliché . 
zellweger 's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a 
a clever script and skilled actors bring new energy to the familiar topic of office politics . 
quietly engaging . 
i 'm going to give it a marginal thumbs up . 
if you think it 's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman 's clothes , then you 'll enjoy the hot chick . 
does n't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films . 
run for your lives ! 
as saccharine as it is disposable . 
or maybe `` how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? '' 
-lrb- hell is -rrb- looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara is n't even halfway through . 
a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama . 
can you bear the laughter ? 
dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments . 
what they 're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . 
after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . 
a nearly 21\/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . 
she 's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness . 
is the kind of movie that 's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low . 
hatosy ... portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue . 
miyazaki 's nonstop images are so stunning , and his imagination so vivid , that the only possible complaint you could have about spirited away is that there is no rest period , no timeout . 
too bad maggio could n't come up with a better script . 
little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction . 
a quiet , pure , elliptical film 
would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed ` the french lieutenant 's woman . ' 
i 'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing 's happening , or the part where something 's happening , but it 's stupid . 
it 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . 
the overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
the film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? 
the story 's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and mr. day-lewis roars with leonine power . 
not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest . 
just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does n't mean it 's good enough for our girls . 
comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire . 
forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
this tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same . 
jeffrey tambor 's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is oscar-worthy . 
in the new release of cinema paradiso , the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned . 
allen shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today . 
compared to his series of spectacular belly flops both on and off the screen , runteldat is something of a triumph . 
this little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation . 
trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible . 
the result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from spielberg , who has never made anything that was n't at least watchable . 
no better or worse than ` truth or consequences , n.m. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater . 
this comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative . 
for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . 
if only it were , well , funnier . 
even murphy 's expert comic timing and famed charisma ca n't rescue this effort . 
devos delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower . 
if you can stomach the rough content , it 's worth checking out for the performances alone . 
... the kind of entertainment that parents love to have their kids see . 
schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park -lrb- as well as one , ms. mirren , who did -rrb- , has succeeded beyond all expectation . 
as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary . 
sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and judaism back at least 50 . 
moretti ... is the rare common-man artist who 's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness . 
judging by those standards , ` scratch ' is a pretty decent little documentary . 
from its invitingly upbeat overture to its pathos-filled but ultimately life-affirming finale , martin is a masterfully conducted work . 
i do n't blame eddie murphy but should n't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
... no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch . 
as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction . 
even through its flaws , revolution 
stands as a document of what it felt like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9\/11 . 
eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation . 
fierce , glaring and unforgettable . 
and that 's a big part of why we go to the movies . 
the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . 
by turns very dark and very funny . 
... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
the lightest , most breezy movie steven spielberg has made in more than a decade . 
the powder blues and sun-splashed whites of tunis make an alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in belly-dancing clubs . 
gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable . 
there are some laughs in this movie , but williams ' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
assured , glossy and shot through with brittle desperation . 
try as i may , i ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` thank you ! ' 
many insightful moments . 
the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d . 
if `` lilo & stitch '' is n't the most edgy piece of disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a watercolor background since `` dumbo '' certainly ranks as the most original in years . 
... bibbidy-bobbidi-bland . 
the wild thornberrys movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate . 
the actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way . 
it 's the kind of movie that , aside from robert altman , spike lee , the coen brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough . 
while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
it is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter . 
a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . 
maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts . 
a non-mystery mystery . 
likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ? 
the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate\/surf culture , the l.a. beach scene and the imaginative -lrb- and sometimes illegal -rrb- ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults . 
though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . 
it wo n't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , finch 's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a saturday matinee . 
almost peerlessly unsettling . 
thanks to haynes ' absolute control of the film 's mood , and buoyed by three terrific performances , far from heaven actually pulls off this stylistic juggling act . 
the movie is like scorsese 's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 
eight legged freaks is clever and funny , is amused by its special effects , and leaves you feeling like you 've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer . 
due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
a sexy , surprising romance ... idemoto and kim make a gorgeous pair ... their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger . 
the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . 
the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . 
in a summer of clones , harvard man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects . 
very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
the most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from portugal . 
a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line . 
the film 's lack of personality permeates all its aspects -- from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed . 
the film is quiet , threatening and unforgettable . 
control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible 
it is n't scary . 
in a summer overrun with movies dominated by cgi aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway . 
it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story . 
below may not mark mr. twohy 's emergence into the mainstream , but his promise remains undiminished . 
-lrb- dong -rrb- makes a valiant effort to understand everyone 's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that family fundamentals gets you riled up . 
there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time . 
a small gem from belgium . 
as ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . 
the locations go from stark desert to gorgeous beaches . 
stale , futile scenario . 
gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
the fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that broomfield 's interviewees , or even himself , will not be for much longer . 
a uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot . 
the ingenuity that parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of wilde himself . 
metaphors abound , but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story . 
in his debut as a director , washington has a sure hand . 
the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure . 
the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
action - mechanical . 
to say this was done better in wilder 's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east . 
in its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , time out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film . 
a film that suffers because of its many excesses . 
and yet , it still works . 
implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most american of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest hollywood document of all . 
... the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 
if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing . 
mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer 's bloated effects fest the mummy returns . 
cq 's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best european directors . 
for those who pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste , this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their \*\*\* off for an hour-and-a-half . 
as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . 
-lrb- while the last metro -rrb- was more melodramatic , confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions , while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history . 
it 's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 
wo n't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world 's best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time . 
it 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication -lrb- and who knew they even had any ? -rrb- . 
the movie is brilliant , really . 
and thanks to kline 's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering is highly pleasurable . 
like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on 
an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video . 
there 's absolutely no reason why blue crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is 
birthday girl does n't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency . 
brown sugar signals director rick famuyiwa 's emergence as an articulate , grown-up voice in african-american cinema . 
on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion . 
about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
dignified ceo 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . 
seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago . 
i love the robust middle of this picture . 
plus , like i already mentioned ... it 's robert duvall ! 
but the talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes . 
some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck . 
jacquot 's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances ... while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself . 
for most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche . 
a triumph of pure craft and passionate heart . 
features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 
a good piece of work more often than not . 
i hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art . 
evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes . 
may take its sweet time to get wherever it 's going , but if you have the patience for it , you wo n't feel like it 's wasted yours . 
thoroughly awful . 
why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me . 
no surprises . 
the performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles . 
a charming , banter-filled comedy ... one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface . 
... feels as if -lrb- there 's -rrb- a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment . 
hashiguchi vividly captures the way young japanese live now , chafing against their culture 's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse . 
broomfield turns his distinctive ` blundering ' style into something that could really help clear up the case . 
that ` alabama ' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon -lrb- who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate -rrb- ... 
been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
it ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery\/thriller , a romance or a comedy . 
you can taste it , but there 's no fizz . 
it 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long . 
a waterlogged version of ` fatal attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set ... a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
` easily my choice for one of the year 's best films . ' 
like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving . 
ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing . 
unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera . 
it 's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure , as long as you do n't try to look too deep into the story 
boasts enough funny dialogue and sharp characterizations to be mildly amusing . 
feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 
with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral . 
outside of burger 's desire to make some kind of film , it 's really unclear why this project was undertaken 
not exactly the bees knees 
several of steven soderbergh 's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . 
a certain sexiness underlines even the dullest tangents . 
... the film suffers from a lack of humor -lrb- something needed to balance out the violence -rrb- ... 
it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . 
it has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing . 
it challenges , this nervy oddity , like modern art should . 
an impeccable study in perversity . 
a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling . 
armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud . 
maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while . 
a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies . 
you do n't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate scratch , and that 's the mark of a documentary that works . 
it 's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed . 
it is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity . 
rymer does n't trust laughs -- and does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart . 
my wife is an actress is an utterly charming french comedy that feels so american in sensibility and style it 's virtually its own hollywood remake . 
limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly . 
as refreshing as a drink from a woodland stream . 
it 's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
i stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights . 
a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration . 
like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels . 
it 's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it 's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance . 
city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . 
he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities . 
a smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie . 
`` cremaster 3 '' should come with the warning `` for serious film buffs only ! '' 
even when there are lulls , the emotions seem authentic , and the picture is so lovely toward the end ... you almost do n't notice the 129-minute running time . 
it 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . 
instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions . 
the leanest and meanest of solondz 's misanthropic comedies . 
... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments . 
there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening . 
here is a divine monument to a single man 's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music . 
it 's a film that 's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio 's animated classics . 
in xxx , diesel is that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners , and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep . 
i liked a lot of the smaller scenes . 
pacino is the best he 's been in years and keener is marvelous . 
for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet . 
to call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest . 
an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
keenly observed and refreshingly natural , swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s.c. , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner . 
what `` empire '' lacks in depth it makes up for with its heart . 
those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give `` scratch '' a second look . 
a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation . 
may be more genial than ingenious , but it gets the job done . 
this one is not nearly as dreadful as expected . 
this starts off with a 1950 's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . 
i 'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking . 
i have n't laughed that hard in years ! 
kudos to the most enchanting film of the year . 
if you ever wanted to be an astronaut , this is the ultimate movie experience - it 's informative and breathtakingly spectacular . 
directed with purpose and finesse by england 's roger mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing , relatively lightweight commercial fare such as notting hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft . 
captivates as it shows excess in business and pleasure , allowing us to find the small , human moments , and leaving off with a grand whimper . 
i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
a funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a british cast to rival gosford park 's . 
this is n't a new idea . 
there 's a part of us that can not help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something . 
soderbergh , like kubrick before him , may not touch the planet 's skin , but understands the workings of its spirit . 
changing lanes tries for more . 
the movie 's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness . 
cinematic poetry showcases the city 's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything . 
yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero . 
the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense . 
the fact that the ` best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it . 
tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
terminally brain dead production . 
that 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` dragonfly . '' 
the movie turns out to be -lrb- assayas ' -rrb- homage to the gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . 
but as you watch the movie , you 're too interested to care . 
each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . 
contradicts everything we 've come to expect from movies nowadays . 
it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28k modem . 
due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director 's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality . 
polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own world war ii experience in his signature style . 
rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle 
a four star performance from kevin kline who unfortunately works with a two star script . 
first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb . 
it still feels like a prison stretch . 
this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month 's end , is tepid and tedious . 
they cheapen the overall effect . 
the production values are of the highest and the performances attractive without being memorable . 
talk to her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be , but it 's still quite worth seeing . 
an engrossing iranian film about two itinerant teachers and some lost and desolate people they encounter in a place where war has savaged the lives and liberties of the poor and the dispossessed . 
even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it 's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon . 
- west coast rap wars , this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate . 
the ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations . 
it is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad . 
frank capra played this story straight . 
a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally . 
this version does justice both to stevenson and to the sci-fi genre . 
the cat 's meow marks a return to form for director peter bogdanovich ... 
what 's most memorable about circuit is that it 's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb . 
beware the quirky brit-com . 
returning director rob minkoff ... and screenwriter bruce joel rubin ... have done a fine job of updating white 's dry wit to a new age . 
proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness . 
hard , endearing , caring , warm .
