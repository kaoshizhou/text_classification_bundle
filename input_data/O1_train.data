just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing . 
a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . 
shafer 's feature does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble .

it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down . 
the sum of all fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots -lrb- or cinema seats -rrb- . 
the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 
at some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill . 
an oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion . 
more whiny downer than corruscating commentary . 
scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance . 
a creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man ... about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy . 
a tour de force of modern cinema . 
the movie does n't generate a lot of energy . 
much of the movie 's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . 
the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life . 
before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway . 
it 's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .

directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 
it 's endlessly inventive , consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage . 
a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
i 'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap cliché . 
the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
... post-september 11 , `` the sum of all fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
despite its visual virtuosity , ` naqoyqatsi ' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
the movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis . 
there is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out . 
too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay . 
dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
with each of her three protagonists , miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman 's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path . 
a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz .

a predictable , manipulative stinker . 
a very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be . 
it 's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits . 
e.t. works because its flabbergasting principals , 14-year-old robert macnaughton , 6-year-old drew barrymore and 10-year-old henry thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet . 
there 's ... tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate . 
instead of using george and lucy 's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george 's haplessness and lucy 's personality tics . 
maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
a delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie . 
all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject . 
terry is a sort of geriatric dirty harry , which will please eastwood 's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man . 
a simple tale of an unlikely friendship , but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances , it has considerable charm . 
the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character . 
it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
a lovely film for the holiday season . 
nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer\/director responsible for this illuminating comedy does n't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully . 
chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .

plays like a volatile and overlong w magazine fashion spread . 
banal and predictable . 
angel presents events partly from the perspective of aurelie and christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale .

the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard . 
what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story . 
a powerful performance from mel gibson and a brutal 90-minute battle sequence that does everything but issue you a dog-tag and an m-16 . 
the banter between calvin and his fellow barbers feels like a streetwise mclaughlin group ... and never fails to entertain .

while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often . 
a fun ride . 
vera 's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . 
this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
that rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed . 
when your subject is illusion versus reality , should n't the reality seem at least passably real ? 
i could n't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
resident evil is n't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail . 
a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
she allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly . 
the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 
compellingly watchable . 
further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap . 
it 's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo . 
an emotionally and spiritually compelling journey seen through the right eyes , with the right actors and with the kind of visual flair that shows what great cinema can really do . 
i was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism . 
a first-class road movie that proves you can run away from home , but your ego and all your problems go with you . 
i felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes . 
... a quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job ... 
it tends to remind one of a really solid woody allen film , with its excellent use of new york locales and sharp writing 
more precious than perspicacious 
an almost unbearably morbid love story . 
both heartbreaking and heartwarming ... just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it 's tremendously moving . 
rife with the rueful , wry humor springing out of yiddish culture and language . 
savvy director robert j. siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense . 
drawing on an irresistible , languid romanticism , byler reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beer-fueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth . 
there 's something poignant about an artist of 90-plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us . 
the casting of von sydow ... is itself intacto 's luckiest stroke . 
i like that smith , he 's not making fun of these people , he 's not laughing at them . 
the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . 
the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate . 
a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide . 
a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures . 
move over bond ; this girl deserves a sequel . 
... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , scoob and shag do n't eat enough during the film . ' 
peralta captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago , the essence of the dogtown experience . 
contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden ... if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
the film 's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . 
while this movie , by necessity , lacks fellowship 's heart , two towers outdoes its spectacle . 
the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating . 
follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
the film 's most improbable feat ? 
swimming is above all about a young woman 's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman 's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds . 
that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults . 
the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ... it 's at least watchable . 
` film aficionados can not help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director 's cut . ' 
in other words , it 's badder than bad . 
woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the `` saving private ryan '' battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
filmmakers dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann area headed east , far east , in retelling a historically significant , and personal , episode detailing how one international city welcomed tens of thousands of german jewish refugees while the world 's democracie 
a cutesy romantic tale with a twist . 
the filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , b movie way , they succeed . 
it gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions . 
it 's a masterpeice . 
do n't even bother to rent this on video . 
like edward norton in american history x , ryan gosling -lrb- murder by numbers -rrb- delivers a magnetic performance . 
there 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down . 
-lrb- t -rrb- he film is never sure to make a clear point -- even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 
as a film director , labute continues to improve . 
becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters . 
a fun family movie that 's suitable for all ages -- a movie that will make you laugh , cry and realize , ` it 's never too late to believe in your dreams . ' 
louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman 's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just does n't make sense . 
dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , the piano teacher is a film that defies categorisation . 
if the man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness , it is also elevated by it -- the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you 're one of the lucky few who sought it out . 
with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low . 
it 's just plain lurid when it is n't downright silly . 
that 's its first sign of trouble . 
using a stock plot , about a boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater . 
stripped almost entirely of such tools as nudity , profanity and violence , labute does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection . 
it 's also , clearly , great fun . 
not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time . 
its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock -lrb- since sept. 11 -rrb- . 
... an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler . 
the movie is well done , but slow . 
tale will be all too familiar for anyone who 's seen george roy hill 's 1973 film , `` the sting . '' 
an impressive hybrid . 
instead , he shows them the respect they are due . 
` possession , ' based on the book by a.s. byatt , demands that labute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit 
certainly the performances are worthwhile . 
the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington 's fine performance in the title role . 
as commander-in-chief of this film , bigelow demonstrates a breadth of vision and an attention to detail that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world . 
well-done supernatural thriller with keen insights into parapsychological phenomena and the soulful nuances of the grieving process . 
you 'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama . 
offers absolutely nothing i had n't already seen . 
elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 
exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 
it 's sort of in-between , and it works . 
it gives devastating testimony to both people 's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good . 
if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage , then esther 's story is a compelling quest for truth . 
woody , what happened ? 
time out is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term . 
a lot of the credit for the film 's winning tone must go to grant , who has n't lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him . 
an old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts . 
despite its title , punch-drunk love is never heavy-handed . 
a stirring road movie . 
the only thing `` swept away '' is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time . 
in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded . 
the only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . 
ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley 's source novel -lrb- about schmidt -rrb- and an old payne screenplay . 
an entertaining , if ultimately minor , thriller . 
solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous . 
while the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo ... broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity . 
funny and touching . 
there are so few films about the plight of american indians in modern america that skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front . 
so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie . 
it 's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . 
cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film 's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein 's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark 's dogma movement . 
a headline-fresh thriller set among orthodox jews on the west bank , joseph cedar 's time of favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation , it does so without compromising that complexity . 
a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . 
one ca n't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney 's latest album . 
this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen . 
the film is ... determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation . 
murderous maids has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud ... and parmentier . 
forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this wo n't seem like such a bore . 
for those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new star wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one . 
my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers . 
that is a compliment to kuras and miller . 
the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . '' 
the movie does n't add anything fresh to the myth . 
a breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy . 
warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . 
-lrb- d -rrb- oes n't bother being as cloying or preachy as equivalent evangelical christian movies -- maybe the filmmakers know that the likely audience will already be among the faithful . 
belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video\/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating . 
wow . 
it is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth . 
there is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when friel pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in williams is as visceral as a gut punch . 
few films capture so perfectly the hopes and dreams of little boys on baseball fields as well as the grown men who sit in the stands . 
the most compelling wiseman epic of recent years . 
the chateau ... is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters . 
the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 
kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 
there 's real visual charge to the filmmaking , and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence . 
a keep - 'em - guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters . 
the graphic carnage and re-creation of war-torn croatia is uncomfortably timely , relevant , and sickeningly real . 
the most ingenious film comedy since being john malkovich . 
handled correctly , wilde 's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . 
with an unusual protagonist -lrb- a kilt-wearing jackson -rrb- and subject matter , the improbable `` formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger . 
this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 
but it was n't . 
an old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale of the kind they rarely make anymore . 
unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . 
violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining . 
by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie . 
an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable . 
both damning and damned compelling . 
not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece . 
it 's such a mechanical endeavor -lrb- that -rrb- it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it . 
philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess . 
the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . 
brisk hack job . 
imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 
director roger kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity . 
adam sandler 's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt 
-lrb- i -rrb- t 's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop is n't as funny as it should be . 
lisa rinzler 's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza 's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension . 
but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness . 
michel piccoli 's moving performance is this films reason for being . 
a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
... the plot weaves us into a complex web . 
intimate and panoramic . 
warm water under a red bridge is a quirky and poignant japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality . 
it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction . 
hardly an objective documentary , but it 's great cinematic polemic ... love moore or loathe him , you 've got to admire ... the intensity with which he 's willing to express his convictions . 
the characters never change . 
a pleasant piece of escapist entertainment . 
sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates . 
there 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film . 
and more than that , it 's an observant , unfussily poetic meditation about identity and alienation . 
despite its shortcomings , girls ca n't swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch , and it 's a worthy entry in the french coming-of-age genre . 
the movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe 's misunderstanding of marivaux 's rhythms , and mira sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress . 
it celebrates the group 's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his ` angels of light . ' 
just send it to cranky . 
those who trek to the ` plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . 
it 's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one . 
in death to smoochy , we do n't get williams ' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing . 
this slight premise ... works because of the ideal casting of the masterful british actor ian holm as the aged napoleon . 
a chilly , brooding but quietly resonant psychological study of domestic tension and unhappiness . 
the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children . 
see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . 
that 's a cheat . 
characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs . 
woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . 
waiting for godard can be fruitful : ` in praise of love ' is the director 's epitaph for himself . 
a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 
a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one 's appetite for the bollywood films . 
it 's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by kwan 's unique directing style . 
it 's got the brawn , but not the brains . 
an ugly , revolting movie . 
the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life . 
boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
at just over an hour , home movie will leave you wanting more , not to mention leaving you with some laughs and a smile on your face . 
unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . 
yes , dull . 
in auteil 's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he 's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer . 
a solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony . 
as action-adventure , this space-based homage to robert louis stevenson 's treasure island fires on all plasma conduits . 
we can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art . 
paul bettany is cool . 
enjoyably dumb , sweet , and intermittently hilarious -- if you 've a taste for the quirky , steal a glimpse . 
it 's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake . 
playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity ... bisset is both convincing and radiant . 
thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all . 
scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle . 
a compelling coming-of-age drama about the arduous journey of a sensitive young girl through a series of foster homes and a fierce struggle to pull free from her dangerous and domineering mother 's hold over her . 
uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
this film biggest problem ? 
funny , sexy , devastating and incurably romantic . 
both a detective story and a romance spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics . 
will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 . 
wang xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men . 
-lrb- grant -rrb- goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering and captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it . 
-lrb- a -rrb- wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting . 
then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
tells a fascinating , compelling story . 
a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 
he 's the scariest guy you 'll see all summer . 
works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making 
sheridan seems terrified of the book 's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony . 
feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 
just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole . 
it 's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies . 
this film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities . 
a film that will enthrall the whole family . 
diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance 
an unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud . 
smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy . 
its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this is n't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare . 
something has been lost in the translation ... another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise . 
the film 's strength is n't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears . 
a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors ... 
nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film ... it 's not even a tv special you 'd bother watching past the second commercial break . 
lathan and diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest . 
i can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer 's diapers . 
wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time . 
a remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point . 
none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him . 
an appalling ` ace ventura ' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . 
a giddy and provocative sexual romp that has something to say . 
a relative letdown . 
too predictably , in fact . 
i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . 
a true pleasure . 
an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 
it 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix 's . 
the story really has no place to go since simone is not real -- she ca n't provide any conflict . 
like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well . 
the imax screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation . 
not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you 'll have a good time with this one too . 
a sharp and quick documentary that is funny and pithy , while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that , while past , really is n't . 
sweet and memorable film . 
spectacular in every sense of the word , even if you don ' t know an orc from a uruk-hai . 
starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 
but it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it 's won . 
for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence . 
a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr. chicken . 
buy is an accomplished actress , and this is a big , juicy role . 
i 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . 
it 's very beavis and butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle . 
in fact , even better . 
-lrb- a -rrb- satisfying niblet . 
shallow . 
epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star . 
i loved this film . 
it 's drab . 
a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 
the cast is top-notch and i predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael . 
mcgrath has deftly trimmed dickens ' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero 's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness . 
the movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life . 
i ca n't recommend it . 
provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views . 
-lrb- an -rrb- absorbing documentary . 
a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life . 
adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of orlean 's themes without being a true adaptation of her book . 
contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin . 
paul cox needed to show it . 
it might be ` easier ' to watch on video at home , but that should n't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience . 
still rapturous after all these years , cinema paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love . 
there 's some outrageously creative action in the transporter ... -lrb- b -rrb- ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it 's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
but they do n't fit well together and neither is well told . 
we just do n't really care too much about this love story . 
a colorful , joyous celebration of life ; a tapestry woven of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters . 
if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you 're far better served by the source material . 
for movie lovers as well as opera lovers , tosca is a real treat . 
the entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood . 
the color sense of stuart little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie were n't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is . 
why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? 
charming and witty , it 's also somewhat clumsy . 
the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito 's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless . 
it 's fairly solid -- not to mention well edited so that it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark . 
transforms one of -lrb- shakespeare 's -rrb- deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy . 
tully is in many ways the perfect festival film : a calm , self-assured portrait of small town regret , love , duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience . 
frei assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who , in spite of all that he 's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic , and retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him . 
cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in kieran culkin a pitch-perfect holden . 
for a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new hal hartley movie to pore over , no such thing is a big letdown . 
try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns ' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde . 
one of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace . 
a great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family . 
they 're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . 
this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
by turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy , never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre . 
a mature , deeply felt fantasy of a director 's travel through 300 years of russian history . 
captures all the longing , anguish and ache , the confusing sexual messages and the wish to be a part of that elusive adult world . 
there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill . 
while obviously aimed at kids , the country bears ... should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio . 
a pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties . 
the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality . 
there is nothing redeeming about this movie . 
it is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them . 
like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but did n't know how to handle it .

this movie has the usual impossible stunts ... but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie . 
it 's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot . 
a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies . 
a stylistic romp that 's always fun to watch . 
goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 
no amount of nostalgia for carvey 's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it .

a whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking christian-themed fun . 
nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . 
its story about a young chinese woman , ah na , who has come to new york city to replace past tragedy with the american dream is one that any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling .

i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin ' down .

i can easily imagine benigni 's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . 
a terrifically entertaining specimen of spielbergian sci-fi .

throughout , mr. audiard 's direction is fluid and quick . 
-lrb- clooney 's -rrb- debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh .

a brutally dry satire of middle american numbness . 
even during the climactic hourlong cricket match , boredom never takes hold . 
ferrara 's best film in years . 
while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari 's film falls short in building the drama of lilia 's journey .

this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea -lrb- or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really -rrb- in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` why ? ' 
what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map .

exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza . 
one regards reign of fire with awe . 
the premise of jason x is silly but strangely believable . 
a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me -lrb- horrors ! -rrb-

well-made but mush-hearted . 
awesome work : ineffable , elusive , yet inexplicably powerful 
a movie where story is almost an afterthought amidst a swirl of colors and inexplicable events .

nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . 
both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter . 
a brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel . 
it 's not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it 's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered . 
you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood is n't going to jell . 
the movie 's seams may show ... but pellington gives `` mothman '' an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling . 
a bittersweet film , simple in form but rich with human events . 
a beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- jealousy , betrayal , forgiveness and murder . 
until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity . 
caruso sometimes descends into sub-tarantino cuteness ... but for the most part he makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty . 
in all , this is a watchable movie that 's not quite the memorable experience it might have been . 
just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting .

the way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful . 
i 'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . 
the film 's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9 \/ 11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind . 
her film is like a beautiful food entrée that is n't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless . 
it 's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
what madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 
on that score , the film certainly does n't disappoint . 
because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling . 
video games are more involving than this mess .

the film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both steve buscemi and rosario dawson ... 
it 's a great american adventure and a wonderful film to bring to imax . 
it 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious . 
it 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate . 
huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair .

the story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director shekhar kapur supplies with tremendous skill . 
i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .

-lrb- t -rrb- he ideas of revolution 
high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government \/ marine\/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there 's something about mary co-writer ed decter . 
he does this so well you do n't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role . 
a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug . 
kapur 's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself . 
enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre .

a weird , arresting little ride . 
its almost too-spectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and good-naturedly aimless story .

the best film of the year 2002 . 
the very definition of the ` small ' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director sprecher .

an instance of an old dog not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick . 
no , i do n't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
as unseemly as its title suggests .

works as pretty contagious fun . 
utter mush ... conceited pap . 
trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the `` gadzooks ! ''

equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid . 
full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , kung pow ! 
shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was . 
a rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd . 
the results are far more alienating than involving . 
at a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons , it 's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form 's history . 
the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms. ambrose . 
a little melodramatic , but with enough hope to keep you engaged . 
seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie . 
feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime ... and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work . 
serving sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time . 
in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide . 
stale and clichéd to a fault . 
a wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films . 
hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 
mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .

a finely tuned mood piece , a model of menacing atmosphere . 
bland but harmless . 
to call the other side of heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be . 
a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 
... too sappy for its own good . 
`` sweet home alabama '' is what it is -- a nice , harmless date film ... 
morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he 's taken one of the world 's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating . 
it 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland . 
one of the most incoherent features in recent memory . 
australia : land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place . 
strip it of all its excess debris , and you 'd have a 90-minute , four-star movie . 
this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . 
drug abuse , infidelity and death are n't usually comedy fare , but turpin 's film allows us to chuckle through the angst . 
it 's a strange film , one that was hard for me to warm up to . 
it 's just merely very bad . 
it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie 's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie 's most admirable quality 
truly terrible .

the magic -lrb- and original running time -rrb- of ace japanimator hayao miyazaki 's spirited away survives intact in bv 's re-voiced version . 
-lrb- soderbergh -rrb- tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 
there 's nothing to gain from watching they . 
there may have been a good film in `` trouble every day , '' but it is not what is on the screen . 
it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . 
though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliché . 
pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick . 
opera on film is never satisfactory . 
the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years . 
not so much farcical as sour . 
the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows . 
the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged . 
a well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone . 
as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .

an edifying glimpse into the wit and revolutionary spirit of these performers and their era . 
terrific performances , great to look at , and funny . 
with ` bowling for columbine , ' michael moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear . 
australian filmmaker david flatman uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them . 
a giggle a minute . 
a thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one 's actions . 
as a director , paxton is surprisingly brilliant , deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip . 
without -lrb- de niro -rrb- , city by the sea would slip under the waves . 
a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama . 
shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera . 
deliberately and skillfully uses ambiguity to suggest possibilities which imbue the theme with added depth and resonance . 
watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . 
it 's got all the familiar bruckheimer elements , and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins\/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas .

an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes . 
not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry , but the film conjures the magic of author j.k. rowling 's books .

these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they 're simply not funny performers . 
sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . 
schaefer 's ... determination to inject farcical raunch ... drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
any movie that makes hard work seem heroic deserves a look . 
the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy . 
rock 's stand-up magic wanes . 
a real snooze . 
much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché . 
an exquisitely crafted and acted tale . 
seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it 's a sad , sick sight . 
but it could have been worse . 
there is a subversive element to this disney cartoon , providing unexpected fizzability .

for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer 's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . 
it is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual

an extremely unpleasant film . 
a reminder that beyond all the hype and recent digital glitz , spielberg knows how to tell us about people . 
the spaniel-eyed jean reno infuses hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart . 
the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film .

a film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy . 
depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . 
-lrb- a -rrb- smarter and much funnier version of the old police academy flicks .

my big fat greek wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor . 
director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 
even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
it 's a technically superb film , shining with all the usual spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team . 
but here 's a movie about it anyway . 
an ambitious ` what if ? ' 
the komediant is a tale worth catching . 
a dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets . 
um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ? 
secret ballot is a funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving . 
given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done .

the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake . 
has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents . 
confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of barris ' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture . 
it 's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime . 
... with the gifted pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically , this retooled machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself . 
seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what 's left of his passe ' chopsocky glory . 
a rip-roaring comedy action fest that 'll put hairs on your chest . 
despite auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .

a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics .

a moving story of determination and the human spirit . 
the directing and story are disjointed , flaws that have to be laid squarely on taylor 's doorstep .

a surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing . 
rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them .

director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , can not overcome blah characters .

this is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain .

things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .

mention `` solaris '' five years from now and i 'm sure those who saw it will have an opinion to share . 
somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood .

this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words do n't really do the era justice . 
with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , hélène angel is definitely a director to watch . 
i could n't recommend this film more . 
a tender , heartfelt family drama . 
a good music documentary , probably one of the best since the last waltz . 
kwan is a master of shadow , quietude , and room noise , and lan yu is a disarmingly lived-in movie . 
the more you think about the movie , the more you will probably like it . 
once the downward spiral comes to pass , auto focus bears out as your typical junkie opera ... 
me without you has a bracing truth that 's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood . 
yet the act is still charming here . 
it 's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat . 
the movie is a desperate miscalculation . 
intelligent and moving . 
if you 're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you 're in luck . 
poor ben bratt could n't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions .

garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work . 
but that they are doing it is thought-provoking .

humorous and heartfelt , douglas mcgrath 's version of ` nicholas nickleby ' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful . 
-lrb- stephen -rrb- earnhart 's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have . 
admirers of director abel ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form . 
once folks started hanging out at the barbershop , they never wanted to leave . 
the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it . 
short-story quaint , touchingly mending a child 's pain for his dead mother via communication with an old woman straight out of eudora welty . 
a disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an alice in wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of tv 's big brother . 
if you grew up on scooby -- you 'll love this movie . 
hugh grant 's act is so consuming that sometimes it 's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are . 
for every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian -lrb- orlando jones -rrb- who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized . 
a compelling story of musical passion against governmental odds . 
the most amazing super-sized dosage of goofball stunts any `` jackass '' fan could want . 
it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . 
the milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
it 's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible .

a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her . 
-lrb- a -rrb- thoughtful , visually graceful work . 
what one is left with , even after the most awful acts are committed , is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into your very bloodstream . 
one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it 's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek 's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin . 
beneath the film 's obvious determination to shock at any cost lies considerable skill and determination , backed by sheer nerve . 
davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is . 
the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor . 
suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 
fulford-wierzbicki ... deftly captures the wise-beyond-her-years teen . 
the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died . 
director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning . 
it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it . 
so unassuming and pure of heart , you ca n't help but warmly extend your arms and yell ` safe ! ' 
this cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell . 
to paraphrase a line from another dickens ' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 
fessenden 's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy . 
the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story . 
loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness . 
miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it 's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images . 
what saves this deeply affecting film from being merely a collection of wrenching cases is corcuera 's attention to detail . 
skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd . 
all in all , an interesting look at the life of the campaign-trail press , especially ones that do n't really care for the candidate they 're forced to follow . 
it 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? 
as the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , -lrb- franco -rrb- has all of dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability . 
grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback 's heidegger - and nietzsche-referencing dialogue . 
a thoroughly awful movie -- dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy ... a weird amalgam of ` the thing ' and a geriatric ` scream . ' 
the sword fighting is well done and auteuil is a goofy pleasure . 
parris ' performance is credible and remarkably mature . 
for decades we 've marveled at disney 's rendering of water , snow , flames and shadows in a hand-drawn animated world . 
drops you into a dizzying , volatile , pressure-cooker of a situation that quickly snowballs out of control , while focusing on the what much more than the why . 
rouge is less about a superficial midlife crisis than it is about the need to stay in touch with your own skin , at 18 or 80 . 
one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . 
scherfig 's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky . 
a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right .

an extraordinary dramatic experience . 
for the most part , it 's a work of incendiary genius , steering clear of knee-jerk reactions and quick solutions . 
brings together some of the biggest names in japanese anime , with impressive results . 
dramas like this make it human . 
it 's just rather leaden and dull . 
yet another genre exercise , gangster no. 1 is as generic as its title . 
this is a more fascinating look at the future than `` bladerunner '' and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen . 
... bright , intelligent , and humanly funny film . 
the story passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge . 
confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it . 
perhaps the grossest movie ever made . 
director lee has a true cinematic knack , but it 's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve . 
the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .

smarter than its commercials make it seem . 
a delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional . 
` synthetic ' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree . 
and he allows a gawky actor like spall -- who could too easily become comic relief in any other film -- to reveal his impressively delicate range . 
franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance sonny needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic . 
elegant , mannered and teasing . 
splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity . 
a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . 
looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
one of the year 's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces . 
the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock 's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal . 
stage director sam mendes showcases tom hanks as a depression era hit-man in this dark tale of revenge . 
`` the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store '' 
it 's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing . 
a simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past . 
all three women deliver remarkable performances . 
watching `` ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale . 
for all the dolorous trim , secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers ' sporadic dips into pop freudianism . 
... a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy ... 
not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream american audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit .

a major waste ... generic . 
even with all its botches , enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment . 
a terrific insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown . 
escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , complicated emotions . 
it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie . 
it 's not only dull because we 've seen -lrb- eddie -rrb- murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 
corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
no , it 's not as single-minded as john carpenter 's original , but it 's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels . 
should be required viewing for civics classes and would-be public servants alike . 
there 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title .

those who are not acquainted with the author 's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep . 
unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of italian for beginners . 
it 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful . 
dogtown & z-boys evokes the blithe rebel fantasy with the kind of insouciance embedded in the sexy demise of james dean . 
a photographic marvel of sorts , and it 's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community . 
if you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time . 
rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine . 
sheds light on a subject few are familiar with , and makes you care about music you may not have heard before . 
an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message . 
loud , silly , stupid and pointless . 
just not campy enough 
it 's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor . 
an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 
the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . 
wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted . 
it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag . 
it 's a talking head documentary , but a great one . 
quiet , adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year ... a true study , a film with a questioning heart and mind that is n't afraid to admit it does n't have all the answers . 
the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it 's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory . 
so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned . 
just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years . 
the film proves unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing . 
a funny , triumphant , and moving documentary . 
world traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it 's certainly an honest attempt to get at something . 
spielberg 's picture is smarter and subtler than -lrb- total recall and blade runner -rrb- , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences . 
flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
twenty years later , e.t. is still a cinematic touchstone . 
try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of kaufman 's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment . 
a well-crafted letdown . 
earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding . 
-lrb- d -rrb- espite its familiar subject matter , ice age is consistently amusing and engrossing ... 
after seeing the film , i can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .

this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento -lrb- a producer here -rrb- , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .

a well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it 's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek or laugh . 
the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities . 
dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song . 
wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty .

exciting documentary . 
an obvious copy of one of the best films ever made , how could it not be ?

a highly spirited , imaginative kid 's movie that broaches neo-augustinian theology : is god stuck in heaven because he 's afraid of his best-known creation ?

garcía bernal and talancón are an immensely appealing couple , and even though their story is predictable , you 'll want things to work out .

the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 
the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . 
it 's not just a feel-good movie , it 's a feel movie . 
despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this . 
colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical ... the rare sequel that 's better than its predecessor . 
an enjoyable feel-good family comedy regardless of race . 
the story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one .

like leon , it 's frustrating and still oddly likable .

even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
by that measure , it is a failure . 
as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut dahmer -lrb- jeremy renner -rrb- and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .

the wanton slipperiness of \* corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art . 
an enthralling , entertaining feature . 
terrific casting and solid execution give all three stories life . 
it can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .

a poignant comedy that offers food for thought . 
it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence 's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere .

no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . 
... somehow manages to escape the shackles of its own clichés to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks .

the story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy . 
i have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short . 
if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
ratliff 's two previous titles , plutonium circus and purgatory county show his penchant for wry , contentious configurations , and this film is part of that delicate canon .

-lrb- woo 's -rrb- most resonant film since the killer . 
matthew lillard is born to play shaggy ! 
not as well-written as sexy beast , not as gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels , but stylish and moody and exceptionally well-acted .

there 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age\/coming-out tale . 
this tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , nicholas meyer 's star trek vi : the undiscovered country .

i love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 . 
a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .

fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 
a surprisingly funny movie . 
she is a lioness , protecting her cub , and he a reluctant villain , incapable of controlling his crew . 
a dazzling thing to behold -- as long as you 're wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles the theater provides . 
a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments -lrb- including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether -rrb- .

director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , bogs down in genre cliches here . 
a distinguished and thoughtful film , marked by acute writing and a host of splendid performances .

mr. goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .

a well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars .

in fact , it does n't even seem like she tried . 
the story is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution . 
as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan 's gifts , which are such that we 'll keep watching the skies for his next project . 
it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot . 
witless and utterly pointless . 
nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .

an engrossing story that combines psychological drama , sociological reflection , and high-octane thriller . 
not only are the film 's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were . 
a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1\/2 . 
if a horror movie 's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then they works spectacularly well ... a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride . 
like many western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about north korea 's recent past and south korea 's future adds a much needed moral weight .

a taut psychological thriller that does n't waste a moment of its two-hour running time . 
a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .
