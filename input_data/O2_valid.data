I would expect this kind of behaviorfrom the Evangelical Born-Again Gospel-Thumping In-Your-Face We're-The-Only-True-Christian Protestants, but I have always thought that Catholics behaved better than this.Friend Dennis, I urge you to follow the example of your fellowCatholics, of who I count many dozens as my friends, and practiceyour faith through good example and decent living and respectfor the common humanity of others. Please do not stoop to thelevel of the E B-A G-T I-Y-F W-T-O-T-C Protestants, who thinkthat the best way to witness is to be strident, intrusive, loud,insulting and overbearingly self-righteous.The imagery in the Song of Solomon is a little bit dated (get it? Middle East - date palms - oh, never mind) but apparently acceptable, on a steaminess level, to be accepted as part of the canon. Fromthis fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible withCatholic doctrine.Is there such a thing as Catholic erotica? Not necessarily a lovestory between people of that faith, but a love story that is notexploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, paysproper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still eroticenough to have a place on a.s.s.I would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify, alsomost of the _Journal Entries_, and _Rings I and II_.I would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography andincrease the erotica. I actually agree with you that nearly all ofthe I've got an enormous dick, and I shot my wad all over her facestories are crap. I count them as noise, which makes my take on thesignal-to-noise ration much lower than many other people's.Since you are one of the few posters here who can actually write decent prose, could you write a few stories for us instead ofoverwhelming us with commentary?  > Anyway, this is a big subject.

Scum has no guilt or freedom tochoose anything.  Griffen does.  God did not make scum when he made Griffen.He made a precious person and this person chose to do wrong.  The same goesfor Dr. Gunn.: But if you are to examine it more closely, Griffen would have preferred that: these children were born -- yet AFTER their birth, did Griffen have any : assistance to offer them?  Did Griffen intend to support them, educate them,: raise them up to be useful citizens?  Did he have any intent whatsoever: to help these children after birth?: Here's the real problem.  Americans have become so insensitive to the needsof others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot seestraight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obviousmoral decisions based on reality.If a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is notconsidered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man hasfled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turnedaway from his responsibility to his wife and child.However, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden,she is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the womansuffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.When the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumedout, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly thathe wishes he could trade places with his child.Ths root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, Myfeelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.And when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.It's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and hisdemons for all of eternity.  Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven, andwe'll ruin it the first chance we get.: Now, I don't really know the answer to these questions, but I've got a real: good guess.: And, it's probably right.: And I wouldn't call *that* 'benevolent', either.: It is a move in the right direction.  As it is now, we don't see ourresponsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The mediabacks us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The onlyresponsibility that sells in the marketplace is that which is justenough to make us feel responsible without showing anything thatmight show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to feel likegood people, but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just giveme the freedom to say I'm good, and the rest of the world can burn.Rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places wherepoor old folks rot until they're dead.  I'll hate my brother and sisterif I wish and I'll cheat on my wife or husband.  Screw the government,because it screws me, and don't talk to me about giving to the churchbecause church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites.But, I'm a good person.  At least I admit what I do.  At least I lovemyself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not thata man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too christian.At the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.We've become a self indulgant, backslidden society no longer responsibleto our children, to our parents, to our families, to our government, orto our God.  This is the root behind justification of every evil, of everycorruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, andof every murder.  Society cannot continue to live like this long.  it willhave to destroy itsself soon, and perhaps in the end, that will be thebiggest blessing this world can hope to see.Why do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around?-------------------------------------------------------------------------I deplore the horrible crime of child murder... We want prevention, not merely punishment. We must reach the root of the evil... It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt from the dreadful deed... No mater what the motive, love of ease,or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed... but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove herto the desperation which impelled her to the crime.- Susan B.

From: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler)Subject: Re: Serbian genocide Work of God?Organization: Freshman, Civil Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PALines: 57D. Andrew Kille writes:>Are you suggesting that God supports genocide?>Perhaps the Germans were punishing Jews on God's behalf?> >Any God who works that way is indescribably evil, and unworthy of>my worship or faith.The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13). And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It isjust to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, theinevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard tograsp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they aredoing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), itmust be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead tothe final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as ispossible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in theeyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just desertsnow rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killingpeople for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, andAnnias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that Hisplan might be accomplished.    But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation toexecute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used tofulfill the chorus of Let his blood be upon our hands of the crowd inJersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punishother nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, Mene, mene,tekel, peres?  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God'sjustice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persiansas their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is theextirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, andthe Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could goon with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point isquite clear.Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us toquestion why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message ofJesus Christ is as follows: Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is athand.  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - Letthe dead bury the dead, come, follow me.  There is not an infiniteamount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people tofollow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, well, alright,you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with yourplans.  He said Follow me.  His message is NOT I'm just a sweety-piewho would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, andDivine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.  Our great God and SaviorJesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of theworld.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to bequestioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.D.

Of course, I said No problem and went to work.Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive usingthe old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.

The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even worse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence zones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army diminished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'dwonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour.

I believe all of thepeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. Ifeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve togo but that they would deserve it more. IMHO Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were hecould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do notthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for thegame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and Istill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had severalseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite abit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some otherpeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantialcontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this aresome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when hewas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up toand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame Ithink it deserves some consideration.Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately woulddeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.Darrell Evans - No.Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (althougha silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am notsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's boththe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Justthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off thetop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.|> |>      Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody|> giving|> |> Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,|> marginal.|> |> Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there.

Italked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have beeninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have verygood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbersoffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run forevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would haveshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays savedgames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win agame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about morethan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame.

Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone mightbring up his name.Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he stillhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then myprobably will turn into a definately.Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about himhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did nothear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has thecontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I wouldnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not eventop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Famebecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALLthe possible votes.So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably dobut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at leastnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O.

From your post, you apparently find the idea thatsomething is wrong with African Americans, value-wise, culture wise orsomething, very appealing. I never cease to be amazed at how eager non africanamericans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assertthat something is wrong with us. The socio-economic factors which we know help to produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large proportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, wesomehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No, that has socioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a dysfunction.Basically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe thatsomething is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want todeal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against africanamericans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible bethat the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this hasa very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us.Non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they are so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage.

Look in the first chapterof that book, introducing the field of macroeconomic theory. Right therein chapter 1, section 1, is a statement like the following:As it is difficult to predict and model wealth creation,especially in an economy where wealth creation is inherentlythe province of individuals who create new inventions anddiscover new ideas, we will assume for the rest of thisbook that there is no wealth creation.We do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world,however the mathematical modeling of such an inherentlyunpredictable subject is impossible. Even though we assumeno wealth creation, we do believe that for most mathematicaleconomic modeling such an assumption is reasonably validas it allows us to make predictions which then can be tested.So the guys who are running the store for Clinton and company are nowassuming that wealth creation does not exists. They are (borrowing anidea from the Hitchhiker's Guide) too advanced to think of these simplethings.To be honist, I would rather have an engineer with years of experiencebuilding bridges design the next bridge, rather than a theoreticalphysicists with a freshly minted PhD and no experience do the same job.- Bill WoodyNormally I don't post (or even read most of the postings) in this newsgroup.If you would like to reply to this message and want me to see the reply,then I guess you will just have to reply directly to me.

There are no otheralternatives.  And if we accept one or the other of those twopremises, then again there are two alternatives, either creation wasrandom, or was according to some plan.   If it was random, I am unable to accept that the complex nature ofour world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creaturescould exist as they do.  Therefore I am left with creation under thecontrol of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme.  I callthat intelligence God.   I also prefer the Creatio ex nihilo rather than from chaos, as itis cleaner.   There is obviously no way to prove either or neither.  We are andwe must have come from somewhere.

How VESA standard works?  Any documentation for VESA standard?2. At a higher resolution than 320x200x256 or 640x480x16 VGA mode,   where the video memory A0000-AFFFF is no longer sufficient to hold   all info, what is the trick to do fast image manipulation?  I   heard about memory mapping or video memory bank switching but know   nothing on how it is implemented.   Any advice, anyone?  3. My interest is in 640x480x256 mode.  Should this mode be called   SVGA mode?  What is the technique for fast image scrolling for the   above mode?  How to deal with different SVGA cards?

Butfor the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plugin the cable to align these.  Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go intothe drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the master driveand which into the Slave?  any help appreciated.  thanks...

They place the title at that positionand the window at a position below it.This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its currentconfiguration and restore is later.Currently, my solution is:XCreateWindow(...);XSetWMProperties(..);XMapWindow(...);XFlush(...);XMoveWindow(...);It works with olwm, but is less than elegant.

If you're prepared to say Let's round these people up andstick them in a concentration camp without trial, it's only a short step togassing them without trial.  After all, it seems that the Nazis originallyonly intended to imprison the Jews; the Final Solution was dreamt up partlybecause they couldn't afford to run the camps because of the devastationcaused by Goering's Total War.

Ithink I have worked hard enough for that.Stauber said he accepts Melrose's choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goaliein their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays6-3 opening victory.But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind RickKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down thestretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backupagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on OlympicSaddledome popcorn.If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...Idropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?  Stauber wondered.  Not that I'd behappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in theplayoffs.Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is notconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.While insisting he is the Kings' goalie of the future, Melrose said Stauberflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,according to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the NewYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to Vancouver on Thursday.Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he couldhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it, Melrose said.  Anelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of agreat goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you'vegot to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everythingis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expectmore from him than he does.Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when theteam hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signedoff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose, said Stauber,a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniateddisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously doexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry doesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'ma perfectionist.Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. But even though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's a bit of a jump, he said.  You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game you're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain to him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I do know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.Melrose's goalie of the future statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. Beforeyou know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future, he said.------*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC Channel 7 here in LA.

He added: What we are facing is pureGreek hatred and racial discrimination.Spelling out the demands of the Turkish ethnic community in Greecehe said We want the restoration of Greek citizenship of 544 ethnicTurks. Their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that thispeople have stayed out of Greece for too long. They are Greek citizensand are residing in Greece, even one of them is actively serving inthe Greek army. Besides, other non-Turkish citizens of Greece arenot subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many ofGreek-Americans have Greek citizenship and they permanently live inthe United States.We want guarantee for Turkish minority's equal rights. We want Greekgovernment to accept the Turkish minority and grant us our civil rights.Our people are waiting since 25 years to get driving licenses. The Greekgovernment is not granting building permits to Turks for renovatingour buildings or building new ones. If your name is Turkish, you arenot hired to the government offices.Furthermore, we want Greek government to give us equal opportunityin business. They do not grant licenses so we can participate in theeconomic life of Greece. In my case, they denied me a medical licensenecessary for practicing surgery in Greek hospitals despite the factthat I have finished a Greek medical school and followed all thenecessary steps in my career.We want freedom of expression for ethnic Turks. We are not allowedto call ourselves Turks. I myself have been subject of a number oflaw suits and even have been imprisoned just because I called myselfa Turk.We also want Greek government to provide freedom of religion.In separate interview with The Turkish Times, Dr. Sadik Ahmet statedthat the conditions of ethnic Turks are deplorable and in the eyes ofGreek laws, ethnic Greeks are more equal than ethnic Turks. As an example,he said there are about 20,000 telephone subscribers in Selanik (Thessaloniki)and only about 800 of them are Turks. That is not because Turks do notwant to have telephone services at their home and businesses. He saidthat Greek government changed the election law just to keep him outof the parliament as an independent representative and they statedthis fact openly to him. While there is no minimum qualificationrequirement for parties in terms of receiving at least 3% of the votes,they imposed this requirement for the independent parties, includingthe Turkish candidates.Ahmet was born in a small village at Gumulcine (Komotini), Greece 1947.He earned his medical degree at University of Thessaloniki in 1974.he served in the Greek military as an infantryman.In 1985 he got involved with community affairs for the first timeby collecting 15,000 signatures to protest the unjust implementationof laws against ethnic Turks. In 1986, he was arrested by the policefor collecting signatures.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Look up shielding in your dictionary.

What do you think 75% of you is?But whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing theneutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly, that means waterturning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactiveswould remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclearwarhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintainceis required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage ina dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For privateownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual mustbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safecondition. If any random private citizen could not properlykeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulationis clearly appropriate.>>  Plus these things have no self->>defense purposes.  It's kinda hard to justify their use as>>a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use>>(low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration>>(translation:  cities and population centers).>If the militia has as its job the overthrow of an illegal>government, they are indeed useful weapons to the militia.I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defendthemselves and their community. If you look at the American revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselvesfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. Theydidn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that sameold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out anddestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suitedfor that.There is also the question of personal and collective arms: TheSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personalweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires membersto provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it coversother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremelydemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower wouldbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popularwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of themembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in theform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia'sfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, notof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quitedifferent from the general public (at the very least, theywould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature andcharacter of the militia requires that each member providea roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personalweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.

For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 isreserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallelport in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need aninterrupt.On the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that hereat work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1,a Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (whichnormally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fightwith a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problemwas that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soonas we disabled COM3, our problems went away.  Grumble ... afterseveral days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work.~ Mike  (sprague.wbst311@xerox.com)

The reason I am threatened by Sciencehas nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence--God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree,Science.My problem with Science is that often it allows us toassume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed uswith the ability to produce life through sexual relations,for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone.Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decisionthrough alterations, that God wills for us to have the powerto decide who should and should not be able to have children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if thatis made possible.People have always had the ability to end livesunnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring livesinto the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificiallycreated life is artificially created death, and as Godhas reserved judgement about when people should die toHimself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about howpeople should be brought in to the world.This is not to say that I reject all forms ofmedical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviatespain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectlyacceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesusto cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,  go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty Godgave us?I cannot draw a solid line regarding where Iwould approve of Scientific study, and where I would not,but I will say this:  Before one experiments with theuniverse to find out all its secrets, one should askwhy they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the bodythey have been given, they should ask themseles why theirbody is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannotmake any general rules that will cover all the cases, butI will say that each person should pray for guidancewhen trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, andshould cease their unravelling if they have reason to believe their search is displeasing to God.---Malcusco

WasDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the frontDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?No. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to MaxFriz's famous design, but with an overhead point cam (see below formore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no groundclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, sothat the ground clearance was substantially increased:      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)                 Viking motor (front) ->   \=@=/This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curvedaround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turnin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connectingrods to accomodate the stroke.The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and stillunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing andand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe wasrequired to drive both overhead valves.Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used apressurized stream of oil to power the waterwheel which kept the lobespinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutalengineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up tonormal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was alittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started thebeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches topressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,uses an electric oil pump. Wimps).Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosivelyfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarilylose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run evenhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. Thiswas feasible because it was a racing engine.With just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towersbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to analmost perfect point:                    /\                   /()\   <-lobe                  / XX \  <-complex linkage (not shown due to valvestems ->   / \  / \    complexity)                |  |   | |                |  |===| |                    =0=  <---piston                     |                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the                             ground, and this drawing doesn't show the                             curvature because there was none in the                             head itself. The bore curve would start                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in                             this diagramThe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits ofthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair offinned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, thename.The Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when itworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionarytechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized thatracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machineswere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly twoSpringers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up anddown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many astwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modernrecord of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcyclehistorians discount this story.Ryan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to RideKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work toDoD

Maintaining a `just friends' level of relationship is much easier said than done.  People usually end up getting hurt.  This is especially likely to happen when they start off with feelings of attraction.  When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement.  I've had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldn't date non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each other.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to their original state.  This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home and fellowship.  I don't think it would work exactly this way for most people.  However, it's important not to underestimate the power of feelings of attraction.  Jayne Kulikauskas/ jayne@mmalt.guild.org

It| > states the 7th day( Saturday ) is the Sabbath while most Christian religions| > keep( or atleast go to church ) on Sunday.  What's up?| | This is a frequently asked question.  Every time it arises, it causes| months of debate.  So let me see if I can answer you directly.| Basically it's because the Law was given to Moses as part of a| specific covenanent with the Jews.  Most of us aren't Jews, so we| aren't part of that covenant.  There was an argument early in| Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to| Gentiles who became Christians.  You can see the account of this| debate in Acts 15.  The main question there was circumcision, but| keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well.  The apostles| concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians,| and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us.1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom4:15 notes that where no law is, there is no transgression.  Not onlydid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before itwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promisewhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of thepeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promisedwhat ever He says to do we will do.  That is why the new covenant isbased on better promises (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the lawGod promised to put my laws in their minds and write them on theirhearts (Heb. 8:10).3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  TheSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempthad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have beeneven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weeklySabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur atany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*the Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, thecovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promisesbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being borninto Israel is not enough For they are not all Israel, which are ofIsrael v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says if ye be Christ's, then are yeAbraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.  All Christians areAbraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not thecriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on thepromise God made to all his people the Israelites.| | While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us,| because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews,| we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected| from the Jews and the things he expects from us.  After all, it's the| same God.  However there are several ways of dealing with this.| | These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments| into moral and ceremonial.  Ceremonial commandments apply only to| the Jews.  They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant.  These are| thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision.  Moral laws apply to| everyone.  Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law, except| for the commandment about the Sabbath.  I believe most people who take| this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on| the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law, but a general obligation to| worship regularly is part of the general moral law.  Thus Christians| are free to choose the specific time we worship.People would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbathcommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates theceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Evenif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagansun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leadersagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions insoc.religion.christian.bible-study).| | A more radical approach (which is generally connected with John Calvin| and the Reformed tradition) says that the Law as a whole is no longer| binding.  Instead, we are entirely under grace, and our behavior| should be guided solely by love.  Portions of the OT Law are still| useful as guidance.  But they are not properly speaking legally| binding on us.  In practice most people who take this position do not| believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce.  While| we may no longer be under Law, as sinners, it's not safe for us to go| into situations with no principles to guide us.  We're too good at| self-justification for that to be safe.  Thus Christians do have moral| guidance, from things like Jesus' teachings, Paul's advice, etc.| These may not be precisely a Law, but they serve much the same| function as, and have largely the same content as, the moral law in| the previous analysis.  While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed| legal responsibility to worship on any specific day, he would say that| given human weakness, the discipline of regular worship is important.| I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what Godsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is theSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was importantenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note thatthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law butfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then incourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives megrace, do I walk out of the court saying I can now go on speeding, for Iam now under grace?  Being under grace I now drive within the speedlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 Di we then make void the law throughfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.  Wherefore the law isholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good (Rom. 7:12).| In both analyses, the specific day is not an issue.  As a matter of| tradition, we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ's| resurrection.  There's some debate about what Acts shows about early| Christian worship.  The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish| Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath, but| that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then.| Act 20:7 shows worship on the first day (Sunday), and I Cor 16:2 also| implies gatherings on that day.| | There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to| worship on the Sabbath (Saturday).  The best-known are the Seventh-Day| Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses.  They argue that Act 20:7 is not a| regular worship service, but a special meeting to see Paul off, and| that I Cor 16:2 doesn't explicitly say it's a regular worship service.Do you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 showsthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul didnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot toAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate lay by him in storewith go to a worship service.| | It's clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul's time.  See| Rom 14:5.  Paul's advice is that we should be very careful about| judging each other on issues like this.  One person sees a specific| day as mandated by God, while another does not.  He who observes that| specific day does it in honor of the Lord.  He who believes his| worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the| Lord.  (Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue| that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here.  Note however Col| 2:16, which says something similar but briefer.  It explicitly| mentions Sabbath.)Wrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbathday of the moral law.| | There are some differences among Christians about use of the word| Sabbath.  Originally the term referred to the 7th Day, the Jewish| day of worship.  Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday, the| day of Christian worship.  They do this largely so that they can apply| the 4th (or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering| schemes) commandment to it.  Reformed tradition does not do this.  It| distinguishes between the Sabbath -- which is the observance mandated| for Jews, and the Lord's Day -- which is the free Christian worship.| (The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev 1:10.)  There| are also differences about laws regarding this day.  Many Christians| support blue laws, both in secular law and church law, setting aside| that day and causing people to spend it in worship.  The more radical| anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish| Sabbath, which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the| Lord's Day.| Why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different argumentswhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from aGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law couldnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of abroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for lawbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not tofollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin tomake false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, tokill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weightwhen placed next to the word of God.Darius[It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  Ithink Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) isprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doingwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equallyaccept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doingtheir best to honor the Lord.However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguousproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As Iindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actuallyabout something else.  They both look like they are talking aboutnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says and theygathered every Sunday for worship.  We get various pieces ofinformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  Act 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish templeworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously thetemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example ofChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell uswhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius'confusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see noreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when theBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies tome that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered tosee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,Paul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicitenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It saysthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul'scollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered speciallyto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it,but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would bewhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to doit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.So I think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first dayof every week simply means every time they gather for worship.  I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statementsis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christianworship was.--clh]

Subject: Space FAQ 03/15 - Data SourcesFrom: leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech)Expires: 6 May 1993 19:55:35 GMTOrganization: University of North Carolina, Chapel HillKeywords: Frequently Asked QuestionsSupersedes: <data_730956427@cs.unc.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: mahler.cs.unc.eduLines: 463Archive-name: space/dataLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:07 $ONLINE AND OTHER SOURCES OF IMAGES, DATA, ETC.INTRODUCTION    A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and    other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.    A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the    remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as    providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com    or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions    on how to make requests.    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.    Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.VIEWING IMAGES    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly    large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To    read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,    use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu    (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP    sites.    The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image    formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document    is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at    pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory    pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.ONLINE ARCHIVES    NASA AMES    Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via    anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and    a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press    releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.    FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in    pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the    archive (the index is about 200K by itself).    To access the archives by email, send a letter to    archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the    subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:send SPACE Indexsend SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in    caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this    section for images or programs.    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are    available in these collections.    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory    contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in    the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is    found in the IMDISP directory (see the item VIEWING IMAGES below).    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to    contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing    specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.    Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee    (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).    NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM    The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and    provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data    from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140    data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can    be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS    also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,    ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to    query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,    keywords, title words, or abstract text words.    ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to    become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu. The User's Guide and    QuickStart Guide are available by anonymous FTP to sao-ftp.harvard.edu    in directory pub/ads/ADS_User_Guide (PostScript files).    Contact Carolyn Stern Grant (stern@cfa.harvard.edu).    NASA JET PROPULSION LAB (MISSION INFORMATION AND IMAGES)    pubinfo.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.6.2) is an anonymous FTP site operated by    the JPL Public Information Office, containing news releases, status    reports, fact sheets, images, and other data on JPL missions. It may    also be reached by modem at (818)-354-1333 (no parity, 8 data bits, 1    stop bit).    Contact newsdesk@jplpost.jpl.nasa.gov or phone (818)-354-7170.    NASA LANGLEY (TECHNICAL REPORTS)    techreports.larc.nasa.gov is an anonymous FTP site offering technical    reports. To get started, cd to directory pub/techreports/larc/92 and    retrieve files README and abstracts.92. Most files are compressed    PostScript. The reports are also in a WAIS database with the following    description:(:source :version 3 :ip-name techreports.larc.nasa.gov :tcp-port 210 :database-name nasa-larc-abs :cost 0.00 :cost-unit :free :maintainer M.L.Nelson@LaRC.NASA.GOV :description NASA Langley Research Center Technical Reports    Contact tr-admin@techreports.larc.nasa.gov.    NASA SPACELINK    SpaceLink is an online service located at Marshall Space Flight Center    in Huntsville, Alabama. The system is specifically designed for    teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current    and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and    technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom    activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a    number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA    Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it    does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments    for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered    electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by    mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during    missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop    between the user and NASA.    SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs    useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images    from NASA's planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.    You can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(V.32) baud, 8    bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), or telnet to spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov    (128.158.13.250, also known as xsl.msfc.nasa.gov) if you're on the    Internet. Anonymous FTP capability (password guest) is now available.    Most of this information is also available from the Ames server in    directory SPACELINK.    NATIONAL SPACE SCIENCE DATA CENTER (NSSDC)    The National Space Science Data Center is the official clearinghouse for    NASA data. The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.    Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.36.23) and    log in as 'NODIS' (no password). You can also get the catalog by sending    email to 'request@nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov'.

As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkituses Xsi.Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system.In order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposedto character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with ASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_tarray must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layoutand application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese',each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.We need a function to do this. The function must check how many charactersfrom the top are the same character set and what the character set is.We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, usedXsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is thesource code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'.//I18N.h// This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*-// $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $

It was the Phils only win in the three game series, andwas the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the youngseason.   The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2John Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers.  However DannyJackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead.Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4,however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.

No problems.  If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at theend.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out andothers are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminationscannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to bedisabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to bedisabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the experts.My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that theymust have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.

Treating people with AZT alone doesn't  happen in the real world anymore, said Dr. Mark Jacobson of the  University of California--San Francisco.  Also, with recent  findings indicating that HIV replicates rapidly in the lymph  nodes after infection, physicians may begin pushing even harder  for early treatment of HIV-infected patients.==================================================================    New Infectious Disease Push American Medical News (04/05/93) Vol. 36, No. 13, P. 2      The Center for Disease Control will launch a worldwide network to track the spread of infectious diseases and detect drug-resistant or new strains in time to help prevent their spread.  The network is expected to cost between $75 million and $125 million but is  an essential part of the Clinton administration's health reform  plan, according to the CDC and outside experts.  The plan will  require the CDC to enhance surveillance of disease in the United  States and establish about 15 facilities across the world to  track disease.      =====================================================================                                  April 13, 1993      =====================================================================  NIH Plans to Begin AIDS Drug Trials at Earlier Stage Nature (04/01/93) Vol. 362, No. 6419, P. 382  (Macilwain, Colin) HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 42Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993     The National Institutes of Health has announced it will start  treating HIV-positive patients as soon as possible after  seroconversion, resulting from recent findings that show HIV is  active in the body in large numbers much earlier than was  previously believed.  Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said, We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will get around microbial resistance.  He said any delay would signify questions over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who co-authored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the  argument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discovery indicates that $1 billion spent on vaccine trials has been a waste of time and money because the trials were started  too long after the patients were infected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument for  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.  AIDS activists  welcomed the new information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understand the significance of infection of the  lymph tissue.  We've known about this for five years, but we're  glad it is now in the public domain, said Jesse Dobson of the  California-based Project Inform.  But Peter Duesberg, who  believes that AIDS is independent of HIV and is a result of drug  abuse in the West, said, We are several paradoxes away from an  explanation of AIDS--even if these papers are right.     ======================================================================                                   April 14, 1993     ======================================================================   Risk of AIDS Virus From Doctors Found to Be Minimal Washington Post (04/14/93), P. A9      The risk of HIV being transmitted from infected health-care  professionals to patients is minimal, according to new research  published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association  (JAMA).  This finding supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an  HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.  In Maryland, 413 of 1,131 patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at  Johns Hopkins Hospital were found to be HIV-negative.  Similarly  in Florida, 900 of 1,192 dental HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 43Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993patients, who all had been  treated by an HIV-positive general dentist, were tested and found to be negative for HIV.  The Florida researchers, led by Gordon  M. Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine, said, This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from  a general dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal precautions are strictly observed.

The OAM is a small division of the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid to become involved in AIDS.  They have to look successful and there is no easy answer in AIDS, she said.    There is also a common perception that the OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists' general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, The OAM advisory panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  will take them several years to accept the nature of research.   Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, Here is a wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the Office time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much more [than  public relations]. ======================================================================   Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, No. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.)      Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in the immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a factor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research  found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte, which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's  research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the body.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface receptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.     ======================================================================                                   April 15, 1993      ====================================================================   AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor Journal of the American Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, George and Nordenberg, Dale F.)      All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,  respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have on many developing countries, and the increased need for international assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book Earth in the Balance a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  change the future of worldwide health. ====================================================================   AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply Journal of the American HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth)      Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  has been the rule.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::                               AIDS/HIV Articles::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children                                H H S   N E W S     ********************************************************************                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES                                March 29, 1993        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected ChildrenThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental HIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as a hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS. Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.  If these vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined closely for other reasons as well.  This trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines, said Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  We need this information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent HIV infection in children. In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected children. HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS. We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or fevers, for example, than another, said Dr. McNamara.  We'll also look at whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other significant laboratory or clinical effects.   He emphasized that the small study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993products. The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug Administration. Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in other Phase I vaccine trials in adults. A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will be told what they receive. If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will begin. Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV itself caused the skin disease. Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses. Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for HIV as well as their own genetic material. NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters contained both normal and transgenic animals. Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the animals. Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were turned on, or active, said Dr. Kopp. The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS                                H H S   N E W S                 ********************************************                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES                                 March 4, 1993     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV infection or AIDS.      The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of San Francisco General Hospital.      Secretary Shalala said, One goal of this project is to share expertise so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.      Secretary Shalala said, This clinical expertise should be especially helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.      The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be answered as quickly as possible.      Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate sources of information or materials.      When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current medications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history.      This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern California.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health Professions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and by the American Academy of Family Physicians.      When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of care they are able to provide to their patients, said HRSA Administrator Robert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  This project will be a great resource for health care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.      This service has opened a new means of communication between health care professionals and experts on HIV care management, said HRSA's associate administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources Development, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  Providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment methods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS.

Magellan has completed 7277 orbits of Venus and is now 32 daysfrom the end of Cycle 4 and the start of the Transition Experiment.4.  Magellan scientists were participating in the Brown-VernadskyMicrosymposium at Brown University in Providence, RI, this week.  Thisjoint meeting of U.S. and Russian Venus researchers has beencontinuing for many years.5.  A three-day simulation of Transition Experiment aerobrakingactivities is planned for next week, including Orbit Trim Maneuversand Starcal (Star calibration) Orbits.     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scramblingcompared with 16 in DES.In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be K is the session key shared by the sender and receiver.  Any method(e.g., public key) can be used to establish the session key.  In theAT&T telephone security devices, which will have the new chip, the keyis negotiated using a public-key protocol. encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK producing     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called thefamily key) and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held bylaw enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  Iwill also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.        The unit key will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow The unit key, also called the chip key, is generated from theserial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocksderived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.Compute the 64-bit block         R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode withtwo keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.(I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact thatthey're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 areconcatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 andthe next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.authorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. Marty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions.Please pass them to me along with your reasons.  In addition to Marty'scriteria, I would add that the agencies must have an established recordof being able to safeguard highly sensitive information.  Some suggestionsI've received so far include SRI, Rand, Mitre, the national labs (Sandia,LANL, Los Alamos), Treasury, GAO.When a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which a message will flow.] My understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that itwill be operated by the FBI.  The service provider will isolate thecommunications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass throughthe decode box, which will have been keyed with K.for the wiretap authorizations. When Levy asked forthe details so he could review the cases as required bylaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turnedover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not        comply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear:         No single person or authority should have the power to        authorize wiretapsNo single person does, at least for FBI taps.  After completing a moundof paperwork, an agent must get the approval of several people on a chainthat includes FBI legal counsel before the request is even taken to theAttorney General for final approval.Dorothy Denning

From: hall@vice.ico.tek.com (Hal F Lillywhite)Subject: Re: Ancient BooksOrganization: Tektronix Inc., Beaverton, Or.Lines: 106{I sent in something on this before but I believe it got lost in theweekend accident the moderator described.  This is an improvedversion anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}The standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents is probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, Hermeneutrik und Kritik, _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of_Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen:Beck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The Prophetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989).(If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibleydescribes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims littleknowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subjectand the reader.)  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the formof rules for forgers.  It makes interesting reading.I confess that I have not read Blass's work, only Nibley's extractthereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required andas far as I know there is no English translation available.  However,I believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancientdocument and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is a later forgery.Actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For examplethe Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientificmeans to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects foundwith them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actualphysical objects.2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although thecopy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find adocument which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of somethingfrom centuries ago (perhaps even having been through severalgenerations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still be tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannotexpect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much sowe must confine our testing to the text itself.It is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us ifthe document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date thedocument and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heardof a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a kingin what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn upscholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have theholograph).  They could check the language, content and writingstyle to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of aPalestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results werepositive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actuallywrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but(barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way todetermine who the actual author was.As I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of thetests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.  Specifically we might ask:1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradictitself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency.For this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time?Again a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if thewriting is of any significant length no latter-day forger would beable to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuousthings which someone from that culture would get right without eventhinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speechetc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?  If so do they fit in with the culture?Of course there are complications if the document has beentranslated, or possibly even if somebody just updated languagewhen he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the cultureclaimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems andreduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.These tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work with) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the historian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to ask are, Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin?  If there are things which don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due toour lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really significant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we neverknow everything about the culture.The end result of any such testing is occasionally certain(particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies).However often it may just be a probability or an indication thatthe document (or maybe parts of it) is probably authentic (orsometimes maybe other parts are later additions).  This is often unsettling to a generation raised on TV where all problems aresolved in 30 to 60 minutes with time out for commercials.  It is, however, the real world and what scholarship has to offer.

We wanted to talk to the internet with the mailpackage so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transportpackage on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what theyrequire to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pcfor the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need anotherdedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mailgoing but you indicate that that is what you want to do.  There is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don't know if itis MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in themail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to aUnix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mailis routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail.Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mailon the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha.Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message headerthen a message saying Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff).  If youcan stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system peopleof course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probablythe problem.  If anyone wants to get help it is only $175.00 for onesupport call. (until problem is worked out)  Phooey to that I say.  Iam looking vigorously for a better Idea.  If you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew,  pleasedrop me a note - anyone.  The next itteration is supposed to have tcp/ipbuilt in THEY say........

I'll post a couple of these a day  unless group concensus demands that I stop, or I run out of good  material.  I haven't been particularly careful in the past about saving  attributions.  I think the following comes from John A. Johnson,  but someone correct me if I'm wrong.  This is probably the longest  of my entire collection.________________________________________________________                                  So that the                                  Prophecy be                                   Fulfilled                                     * * *       In considering the Christian religion, and judging itaccording to its claims, it is important to look at its claims atfulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy.  The scribe Matthew is perhapsthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers inthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's mainstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not evenabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances inthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of theauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written atleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how muchhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, wewill take particular claims at face value.Immanuel:       We begin, of course, at the beginning.       (Mt 1.21-22):  [Mary] will bear a son, and you,       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is       salvation), for he will save his people from their       sins.  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had       spoken by a prophet:       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the       lord G'd said to Isaiah, go to meet with Ahaz...        ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,       naturally) saying, Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.  But,       Ahaz said, I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a       test.  Then (Isaiah) said, Hear then, O house of       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman       is with child and will bear a son, and name him       Immanuel, which means, G'd is with us.   He will       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings       you dread will have been deserted...Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. Further, he the Hebrew word almah, (young woman), asspecifically, virgin.  But, this is not a prophecy about theMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 yearslater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  Inshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out ofcontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  Itshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a generalmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of bylater Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called bythe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecyfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a secondclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.Egypt:       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about aquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if hewishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape analleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:       Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.What the lord really said was this.       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him.        And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called       them (my people), the more they went from me; they       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning       incense to idols.Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, itwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted toreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken ofhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we windup with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecyis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.Rachel Weeps:        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says thatKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions ofall young male children.  Matthew then writes,       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:       A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;       she refused to be consoled, because they were       no more.   The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to thecarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are nomore.  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and diesbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, whowas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus andBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her children,it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem isthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikelythat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but theevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far lessevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be aprime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhancethe message of the church's gospel.       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of theinfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device setup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mentionthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The children the prophetspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'dcomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will bereturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, thiswould not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of aredead for good.  Again, the prophecy Matthew sets up is not eventhat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not tooconvincing.The Nazarene:       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to findanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wifetake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth,        [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets       might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene.First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name ofthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who He is. There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Stillworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament atall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother thatshe will,       [Judges 13.5]  ...conceive and bear a son.  No razor       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel       from the hands of the Philistines.This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew hasbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he issimple making them up now.Bearing ourDiseases:       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnessesand disabilities.       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the       prophet Isaiah, He took our infirmities and bore our       diseases.As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know thatthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nationof Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to theIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nationsthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewishidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as theinstrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses whichare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt anddiscipline.  They do not speak of a servant going around andhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on thesicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  Theverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, butrather something that had already happened.  While it is believedthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bearthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to saythat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in hisspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallelmisses where he intended it to have its effect.Silent Messiah:      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesusordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arousethe attention of the local rulers.       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by       the prophet Isaiah.          Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his       name.The Isaiah passage quoted reads,       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands       await his law.You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians couldnever think of Jesus failing, never would the light of mankindburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come toan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embraceG'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all willbe the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changedfrom the Judaic ...the coastlands await his law. to theChristologic, the Gentiles will hope in his name.   While theoriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites itto fit its strange doctrine of believing in the name.  If onehas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has onlyto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the belovedbut blind and imperfect servant, a people robbed andplundered...   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt atprophecy is examined, it crumbles.Three Days andThree Nights:      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the verymouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion andresurrection.       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and       three nights.Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to knowhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset6pm.  What was referred to as a day was the period of light from6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our timescale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate theirsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. (It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget thatSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylightportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwiseunresurrected for three days and three nights.      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the ninthhour, which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into thegrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, rose,before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath wasover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time forclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pmFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this meansusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, twonights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly thisis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way weare even able to have his death involve three days and threenights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led tosuspect that this error is another one of Matthew's littlemistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into hisgod's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is morethan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.Hearing &Understanding:     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences inparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, ifyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand themessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand theparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understandthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will notaccept the plain message any better.  Matthew says,       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says,        You will indeed hear but never understand; and you       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal       them.The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, hiscall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel isflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, Go, and say to this       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and       turn and be healed.  Then Isaiah said, How long,       lord?  And he said, Until the cities lie waste       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still       stands when the tree is felled. The holy seed is its       stump.Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israelto stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms thepromise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you readthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the planof G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Lookat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portionof Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn'tunderstand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses arenot prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in thepresent.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face.      Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like theyhave the prophetic approval.       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the       prophet, I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I       will utter that which has been hidden since the       foundation of the world.Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from aprophet, but from the Psalms.       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us.        We will not hide them from their children, but tell to       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the       lord...As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really comefrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copiesof Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover someof it up.     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, onceagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesushas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will notunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. Further, they speak of things known, that our fathers have toldus.  Jesus deals with things hidden since the foundation of theworld.  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  Nowonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't theonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.Excuses ofLittle Faith:       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to goaround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing whatepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease werepossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples wereunable to dispossess the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no moreenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, sayingthey didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was thisdemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith orhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to movemountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that canmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles theCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips toMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some oldwoman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded inancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in theirsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding inheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return andtheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.       Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant timeor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in theold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All thetheologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to seeGod anymore.       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're       sinful; it's just his plan; we put too many of our       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dearreader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to betrue. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching yourheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do ismake people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They sayour little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, theysay, See the love in these people you worship with... see thelives of people change... that is seeing G'd.   Thus people getlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everydaysights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it isnot seeing G'd the way people used to see.        What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion ofhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, theforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty createdby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these arewhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybodyhas little faith.Jesus Rides onan Ass:       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiahking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride intoJerusalem.         [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken       by the prophet, saying,       Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold, your king is       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a       ass-colt.Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a littledifferently.       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-       colt... he will command peace to the nations.There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariahonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads thepoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call forboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get acomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle twodonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account writtenearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought toJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, andshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he hasbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, Ihave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,the situation is often reversed nowadays...       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests wereangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesuswas never one to point out such little prophetic things ANDsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems tofit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus orMatthew, Haven't you read? for the source reads,       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the       enemy and the avenger.The passages hardly need comment.  There is no perfect praisespoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to bejust one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient propheticscripture.YHVH said to my lord...:      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewishmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is kingDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,       The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until       I put your enemies under your feet.Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidicdescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Ofcourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying tomake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divinenature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if oneis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. But, there are problems.       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about themessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to themessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scripturesabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David'srule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and thepassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as theChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of thispsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time hadalso made.  One must remember that there were various factionsamong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of themessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, likehis audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, andwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,       YHVH's utterance to my lord:Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your       footstool.       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the       holy mountains.         You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek       forever.The word lord is often mistakenly capitalised by Christianbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, theword is adoni, and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply meanslord, a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often inthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely anaddress of respect.        There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the wordrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this issupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of thepsalm translates to either a psalm of David, or a psalm aboutDavid.  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a courtpoet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If thepsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would betalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descendedfrom David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensivetales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include anypraises of a messiah.     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long afterDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show offavour for David's kingdom on hold.       The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David waspromised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achievedthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, thoughhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, thisevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew offa little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel ofMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition ofan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As wemight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up byembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.Moses & Jesus,Had it TogetherAll Along...:       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see apseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of Johndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removedfrom the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The earlychurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiahking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises madeby G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote ofa promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While thiswas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, theChristians who came along later decided that they would claim thefulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on thepromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testamentwhich corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for thecourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just likehis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith hasmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising theystill cling to it.The Potter'sField:      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem byone of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief       priests, taking the silver, said, It isn't lawful for       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood       money.  So they... bought a potter's field with it to       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,       And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's       field, as the lord directed me.This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old TestamentScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the nameof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses whichMatthew makes use of.       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, Cast       them to the treasury, --the lordly price at which I       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of       YHVH.First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayerof the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likelya priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the peopleshortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict withone another.  The word, treasury, had been replaced by the KingJames Scholars with to the potter, precisely because this madeMatthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  Thecorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed treasury, which alsomakes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas potter'sfield is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation wasintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, givenMatthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion ofintentional dishonesty.      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering thetext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and ifas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregardthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy totoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariahdirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the highpriests.  The high priests would not put the money in thetreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly theopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,the prophecy as presented by Matthew would be taken at NewTestament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincingenough.Wine, Vinegar,& Casting Lots:      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,       They parted my garments among them, and upon my       vesture did they cast lots.First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sourwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We findthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give himsome to drink --not polluted with gall.       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, I thirst.  A bowl of       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he       had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished;But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from theprophets, but one from the Psalms.       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the       Book of the Living.Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his requestof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalmquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  Itis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising thatwe run into further problem when we see that the Jesus in thepsalm asks G'd for the damnation of the crucifiers, whereas theJesus of the gospels says,       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, Father, forgive them, the       don't know what they do!Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy byhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not hismeat, as the psalm stipulates.       With the prophecy of the vinegar faulty, we naturallyask, What of the casting of lots?  This brings up the 22ndPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now tosay that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is nogreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felonin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the leasterroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It doesindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality ofJesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises somesuspicions.The 22nd Psalm:      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of hiscondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song ofpraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of itseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  Wewill examine the primary passages.       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?!        Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, ratherthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does notfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured ascomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like thelamb led mute before its shearers.  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do muchgroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry byboth day and night on the cross.       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men...        All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag       their heads;  He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let       him deliver him... for he delights in him.This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with theexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christianfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words have pierced reallydo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my       hands and feet...In Hebrew the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb formwhich can mean pierced differ by one phonetic character.  Theword in the Hebrew text is literally, like the lion (ka'ari),which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animalimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience thatwould urge a Christian to change the word to ka'aru.   But, toadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the prophecy this isjust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While thecorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring toJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of thetranslators.       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lenditself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer beingsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits thepsalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now knowthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but ratherthe forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditionalthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars onhis palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does notattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lordJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of allthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories andinterpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much thesescriptures may have contributed to what actually got written downis a question that has serious repercussions for Christiantheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithfulfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament mighthave been enhanced by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scripturalmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said goodthings for St. Matthew.The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus'scrucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years afterthe fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...       The will look on him whom they've pierced.Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out ofcontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation ofIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war withthem.       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him       like you weep over a firstborn child.John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker thatMatthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts morethan just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious andblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospelwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of theirreligion were founded.Reckoned withTransgressors:       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claimingthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version ofthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the       scripture was fulfilled which says,       He was reckoned with the transgressors.Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about themessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and itssurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  Theverses are also about what this servant has gone through in thepast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  Theservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit thedescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about themessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus betweentwo thieves would fulfill the prophecy in Isaiah.  Jesus wouldmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He wasconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout hiscareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way tosteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark couldhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.       Mark goes on to tell us how those who were crucified with[Jesus] also reviled him. [15.32]  This is to be expected from acouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Lukedecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged       with him railed, Aren't you the messiah?! Save       yourself, and us!This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how thepeople who crucified Jesus said, Save yourself! and that therobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,       Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds.        But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,       Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.        And Jesus answered, Verily I say to you, today you       will be with me in paradise.Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretchesthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebukinghis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a ratherstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of hispunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to havebeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created byLuke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easyenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was madeup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error freewords of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet anotherexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage andexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we haveseen.The End of theWorld--       Mt. 24:       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary andembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in allthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the mostunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesusmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, andhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the worldwhich he has been warning about.       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your       coming, and of the close of the age?       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for       many will come in my name, saying, I am the christ.         ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the       beginning of the birthpangs.             They will deliver you up... put you to death,       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to       the mountains.             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out       his angels... and gather his elect...             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these       things, you will know that He is near, at the very       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not       pass away until all these things take place...             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming       at an hour you do not expect.From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would inwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tellsthem that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that itwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wettheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told hisdisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to beswept away.      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrantnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, this generationshall not pass away... really means this race of people will notpass away...  Of course, the word for generation is used manytimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it isquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (atleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by lookingat the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear fromRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesusmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24thchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine howtired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting forjust the right moment to spring?       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, orthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or threeeternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes forless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divineradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the bestinterests of his new religion to stick around, and thereforedisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus whenpeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We haveseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughoutChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simplebelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved withargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept awayfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been theeasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, theprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largelyaccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianityhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to supportwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of whichChristianity can securely keep hold.       [Mt 10.34]  Jesus: Don't think that I have come to       bring peace on earth.  I haven't come to bring peace,       but rather a sword.

I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyaltiesmore than names honouring personages.  And of course, they would not appearnearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time.  Another thing that bothers me is the points system.  Percentages, as used inthe other major sports are clearly more informative.  When I look at theNHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation toaccount for games in hand (which is almost always the case).  Some willobject to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an Americanizationof the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative andwhether it is American or not is irrelevant. >If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not >central to the original article.

Those who have been inside burninghouses know that if they want to stay alive, it's better to run outfrom the building. We had one case where an FBI agent *had to drag out a women* from the burning house, she run back in whenshe saw the forces arriving. It is a good indication of the fanaticalmind that the followers had -- including having they children burnedinstead of saving these innocent victims of the instance.Cheers,Kent---sandvik@newton.apple.com.

I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. Justas examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in thehead, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens(Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Ofcourse he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic matchpenalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a fewyears ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt inmy mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's alsovery good.How about that Tocchet head-butt? Is there an automatic susppension thatgoes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty? I can't remember anymore.Oh, the playoffs should be fun,Ralph

Hamas figuressignificantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israeldeported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response toHamas's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longerversion appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine, whichobtained and translated the tape.)      My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [arefugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finishedhigh school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to workfor Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I'm married and I havetwo daughters.     The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestineexplicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern isPalestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men andwomen have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli]Security Services.     Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation,cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our mostimportant objective must be to put an end to the plague ofcollaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate andinterrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and exposethe methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians intocollaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally,we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.     We don't execute every collaborator. After all, about 70percent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed intotheir misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator isbased on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like manycollaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the IsraeliBorder Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once.He's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like anIsraeli soldier.     There's another group of collaborators who perform an evenmore loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young menand women in blackmail schemes that force them to becomecollaborators. I regard the isqat [the process by which aPalestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person asgreater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone isguilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religiousduty to execute him.     A third group of collaborators is responsible for thedistribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from theSecurity Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Theirvictims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit andimpossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get thedrugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.     In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method ofuncovering collaborators, We can't afford to abduct an innocentperson, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnishedforever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only afterevidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. Ifafter interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond anydoubt, then he is executed.     In many cases, we don't have to make our evidence againstcollaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty.But when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is acollaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask forevidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must beirrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usuallyobtained in the form of a confession.     At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we startoff by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tellhim that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in thelast moment of his life, by confessing and giving us theinformation we need.     We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he hasbeen a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of themconfess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we applypressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdoutsconfess as well.     Only one collaborator has ever been executed without aninterrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen workingfor the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himselfconfessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed theinformation to us. In addition, three members of his network ofcollaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With thismuch evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we arevery careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, ourprincipal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until hehimself confesses his crimes.      A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list ofcollaborators to decide whether there were any who could beexecuted without interrogation. An although we had hundreds ofnames, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could notmark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, forexecution.     When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. Butafter we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him-- to do so might give away our locations. That's why collaboratorsare strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, What do youthink? How should we execute you? One collaborator told us,Strangle me. He hated the sight of blood.-----Naftaly Stramer  | Intergraph ElectronicsInternet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com      | 6101 Lookout Road, Suite A    Voice: (303)581-2370  FAX: (303)581-9972 | Boulder, CO 80301Quality is everybody's job, and it's everybody's job to watch all that they can.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port        2. X terminals        3. NeXT        4. Silicon Graphics        5. IBM RS/60006. Other stuff    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial portIf you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time findinga vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstationruns the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap usedPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cableto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to readthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, andeven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a serverextension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if yourserver can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these stringsappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,or bugging your vendor.kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.    2. X terminalsAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) usePC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be allset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through thetrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals addextra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard aroundfor the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.    3. NeXTNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple DesktopBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced theywere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind ofupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!    4. Silicon GraphicsSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 andbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don'tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's notpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except byupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for moredetails.    5. IBM RS/6000IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.

Other stuffSome vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to yourqueries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you canget sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (eitherfrom the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be inluck.  Contact the companies for more details.Apple Adjustable Keyboard    Apple Computer, Inc.    Sales offices all over the place.    Availability: February, 1993    Price: $219    Supports: Mac only    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not    directly attachable to the keyboard.    As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from    TidBITS available there.FlexPro Keyboard    Key Tronic    Phone: 800-262-6006    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)    Price: $489 (?)    Supports: PC only (highly likely)    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's    another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both    the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.    The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.    Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will    probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.DragonDictate-30K (and numerous other Dragon products)    Dragon Systems, Inc.    320 Nevada Street    Newton, MA  02160    Phone: 800-TALK-TYP or 617-965-5200    Fax: 617-527-0372    Shipping: Now.

The program is called a2x, and isavailable via anonymous ftp:soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/a2x.tar.Zexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/a2x.tar.Z (most current)If you want to use your Dragon product with X windows, you may wantto ask for Peter Cohen, an salesman at Dragon who knows more aboutthis sort of thing.    Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.    Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles    (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you    a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number    of popular word processors and spreadsheets.    Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions    to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple    people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file    for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.    On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between    words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.    I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.    The DragonDictate-30K can recognize 30,000 words at a time.    The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.

Despite appearances, the key layout resembles    QWERTY, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is    that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.  The whole pod    tilts in its base, to act as a mouse.

You purchase    compatibility modules, a new cord, and possibly new keycaps, and    then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines.    It's a three-piece folding keyboard.  The layout resembles the    standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each    section is on a custom telescoping universal mount.  Each section    independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each    individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three    sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each    section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections    flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).Kinesis Ergonomic Keyboard   206-455-9220    206-455-9233 (fax)    Kinesis Corporation    15245 Pacific Highway South,    Seattle, Washington 98188, U.S.A.

The layout has a large blank space in the middle, even though the    keyboard is about the size of a normal PC keyboard -- slightly    smaller.  Each hand has its own set of keys, laid out to minimize    finger travel.  Thumb buttons handle many major functions (enter,    backspace, etc.).    You can remap the keyboard in firmware (very nice when software won't    allow the reconfig).

This is simply what belief means.Unfortunatly, this seems to be how Christians are taught to think whenit comes to their religion. Some take it to the extreme and say thattheir religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachingsthen you won't be saved. It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claimto know what God thinks/wants. Especially when it's based upon yourinterpretation of a book. The logic in the above statement is faultyin that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both becorrect. It's all about perception. No two people are exactly alike.No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe thatthere is one truth. Call it God's truth, a universal truth, or call itwhat you will. I don't believe God presents this truth. I think it isjust there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer,meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. Just because people mayperceive this truth differently, it doesn't mean one is wrong and theother is right. As an example, take the question, Is the glass halfempty or half full? You can have two different answers which arecontradictory and yet both are correct. So, for your belief to betrue, does not require everyone else's belief to be wrong.[If a person has what they believe is convincing evidence that Godwill save only Christians, it's hard to see how you can criticize themfor arrogance for saying so.  It could be that they're wrong.  But Ihardly see that it's arrogance.  Let's look at this a bit closer.Suppose we had some combination of prophets and messiahs that taughtus things, but didn't say anything about exclusivity.  If we believethem, and then add and anybody who believes anything else is damned,then you could well criticize us for arrogance.  But in this case theexclusivity is in the message as it comes from the prophets, etc.  Sowe could be wrong in believing it, but I don't see how we can becalled arrogant.  Maybe the world isn't a soft place.  Maybe certainchoices actually do have eternal consequences.  I can see calling theChristian message arrogant, in a certain sense (though only in thesame sense as calling the law of gravitation arrogant because itdoesn't give us any option over whether we fall if we jump off abuilding).  But not Christians for passing it on, given that theybelieve it.  The complaints I can see making are (1) that Christiansare wrong, or (2) that God is arrogant.  --clh]

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the wild>idea stage or does it have real funding?      Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of theCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:  SPACE ADVERTISING    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is verycommon practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on thespace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the(very prominent) logos on its side of   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and   - the GPS/Navstar program office   This has not been considered paid advertising but ratherpublic relations, since the restrictions have been such that onlyorganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on theside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, puttinga 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the camerasis advertising as much as it is public relations, in myopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle hasrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentialsfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing largeadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know ofseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked atputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payloadbay.  These ventures would be different than public relations, inthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firmsparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums forthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (Forexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting aDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameraswould scan past it.)  ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowedto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoecompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the lastOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items fromparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, forexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of theBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launchvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMETrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisementson the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie The LastAction Hero.  Besides the usual logos of the participatingorganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on themain fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its boosterrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth forone month.  A concept for this advertising display was published inSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, istalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea hecreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertisingsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for thespace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space onthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it would not usehis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA andreceiving compensation.   This is being disputed, since the launchis a commercial launch and NASA is receiving none of theadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program iscoming from NASA.)  ORBITAL BILLBOARDS   Orbital billboards have been the staple of science fiction forsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and RobertHeinlein described another in The Man Who Sold the Moon.  Severaldifferent potential projects have been developed, although none havebeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the EiffelII project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture inorbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.

The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil andhis angels.To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory withthe fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed, remember the Bibleteaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement.

Why do I say this?Because by the things you write on the net, and the manner with whichyou write them, you show me that you made up your own god and areattempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you.Yours doesn't at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn't come to youbecause your god doesn't exist.>I've gone into this with an open mind.

Zeus seems like a pretty cool candidate...I am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind.What I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.>Please tell me what more I can do while still remaining true to myself.Be true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain knowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read theBible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything andthere exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyondour shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But aperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing onewill gain with that attitude is folly.Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passagesin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that eventhough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies suchdeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, You will neverbe thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):    It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:   No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.And in John 3:16:   For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal   life.You are included in whosoever.  And I also pray that the Father isdrawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be postingto talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in themaking.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasurestoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul becameon of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, becauseyou could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attackChristians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would probably say to you: Satan would surely like to have you.  Why so?Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated greatmoments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a taskhe did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have thefaith to walk on water as Jesus did.You asked Why not believe in Zeus?  Zeus didn't offer eternal life.You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.-------------------------------Brian Ceccarellibrian@gamma1.lpl.arizona.edu

I saw him play in the Swedish championship game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game, but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does (I suspect you would like to have a Ulf type-of-player on the B's team too? :) As for Mariusz Czerkawski, he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in division 1. He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season, and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play in Elitserien next season, unless the B's can get him of course. I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to watch in Swedish hockey this season.

I kid you not.This is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbinglayers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.Most helmets lose their protective properties because the inner linercompacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged ordelaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many yearsfollowing his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can loseup to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I havea video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.Puncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, andother relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when thecomfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriouslydegrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit ofparking your lid on the mirrors, I suggest you look under thecomfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantlydamaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.--Jerry Lotto <lotto@lhasa.harvard.edu>         MSFCI, HOGSSC, BCSO, AMA, DoD

For those who have not heard of this effect, you put acurrent through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one sideto the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  Ithink a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box forpicnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and acouple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with anefficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten mycar battery in about half an hour).Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basicspecs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as thetemperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumablyits power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually wehave a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming noleakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between thetwo sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more(although that would be a lousy way to control it).What I would like to know is:1: Are the above guesses correct?2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?   (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm   too fast when I unplug it)3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?

From: xx155@yfn.ysu.edu (Family Magazine Sysops)Subject: THE EMPTY TOMB...Reply-To: xx155@yfn.ysu.edu (Family Magazine Sysops)Organization: St. Elizabeth Hospital, Youngstown, OHLines: 218                    THE EMPTY TOMB:  CAN WE TRUST IT?                   by the late Wilbur M. Smith, D.D.                              (1894-1977)          When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about     Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:                 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son               of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief               priests and unto the scribes, and they shall               condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him               to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and               to crucify Him; and the third day He shall               rise again (Matthew 20:18-19).          Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,     who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving     reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He     knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious     leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that     one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual     death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly     how He would die--*by crucifixion.*          All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the     minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted     would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise     again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.          But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-     tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-     tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.          The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth     between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and     ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which     had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against     the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had     predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and     on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the     disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some     of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the     tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,     they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back     to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and     John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the     tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came     hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them     to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).          How did this tomb become empty?          One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--     professor of New Testament literature in a large theological     seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*     the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by     bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb     became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the     chimney at Christmas time.          But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down     any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa     Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the     tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.          Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-     bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by     mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.          Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,     tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar     in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)     that the women went to the wrong tomb.          The facts are these:          First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to     which by mistake they could have gone.          Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or     more people to forget the place where they have buried their     dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women     did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to     the wrong tomb?          Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?          There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the     evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.                  Now when they were going, behold, some               of the watch came into the city and showed               unto the chief priests all the things that               were done.  And when they were assembled               with the leaders and had taken counsel, they               gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,               Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole               Him away while we slept.  And if this come to               the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and               secure you.  So they took the money, and did               as they were taught:  and this saying is com-               monly reported among the Jews until this day               (Matthew 28:11-15).          This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the     fact that the tomb was empty.          You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never     questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to     see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.          Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that     the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples     came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*          How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?     Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.          Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject     the explanation, the very character and the later history of the     disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away     the body of Jesus.          First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in     Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to     contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His     resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there     had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,     then proved.          Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would     have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.     It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most     of these men did.          The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ     had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it     would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed     pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing     humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today     as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.          But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to     leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to     what had happened to Him.          Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.          He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning     (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-     18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He     walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that     night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper     room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).          A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at     the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren     on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the     apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-     8).          As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-     ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed     attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are     unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the     unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the     appearances.          Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our     leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are     antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest     thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.     Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;     Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of     Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president     of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.          But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has     it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:     it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.          Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He     claimed to have come down *from* God.          He said He was the way *to* God.          He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.          He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one     else had it.          He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to     us.          Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed     that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*          Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe     that His words are all true?          The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us     that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?          And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead     testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some     day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.          In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all     this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For     He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-     ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a     hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.          Those who have tried it down through the ages--*and there have been     many*--have given their testimony.  And we today who believe also know.

If there is source on this kind of info, please let me know. I just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension),and I am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386.        The station has a power supply, two floppy disk drives, and the bigcase. I have SONY 1304 monitor, SyQuest drive (Mac), and maybe a cd-romreader (Mac) for it. Here are the questions I have so far:1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case?2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard diskremoved. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do Ihave to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work?3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station? I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in?What's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost?Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC ifI can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a MPC- quality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the husslethan just buy a new 486 station? BTW, I need to buy a keyboard for it too.Any input is welcome.Thank you.Peter Liu

GANDLER) writes:>>How does the radio Electronics free information cards work.>Do they just send you some general information about the companies that>advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a>catalog. That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertisergets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readerswho circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data onself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide thedata on computer disk.The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You willnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly calleda bingo card in the industry) includes lines for a company nameand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, nationaladvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals asbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your companyand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probablysend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineercall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are theywill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retailoutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you the whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, havenothing to mail out accept the catalog.A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industrymagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. Theyuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do readthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or pushyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compilehow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that 23% of readersrequesting data were interested in capacitors. And finally, somemagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. Forexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested informationabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazinesinclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, theadvertiser can attempt to cull out the literature collectors fromthe serious potential customers.Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of  weeks later.  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data  on a computer printout.  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're  not really qualified for, send in a bingo card at least every  other month and circle two or three numbers.  Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.  Advertisers almost never call.

[Honestly.]The word of Sin is Restriction. [Would I kid you?]Does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousandsof individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting theOrder.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted muchdifferently than had one applied them within the confines oftheir original expression.I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior of the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bitfrom Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremesto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.I have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surelyhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order for many years.Yet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look backso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this isonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassedwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that therewas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Orderitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.Let us examine this issue a bit more closely....In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialistand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the OrdoTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where hemet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  Kellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by FranzHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked togetherprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902in Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death,Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition ofthe 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taughtsecret of sexual magic. Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 inAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist andpossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the SocialistLeague founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss waslater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the GoldenDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss tofound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After severalattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on thedevelopment of the O.T.O.The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership.For example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlinand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting betweenReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him andaccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him forthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of allthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invokedwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering astroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a breakin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeplyinfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation._An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'Within _Equinox III:10_, Edited by   Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,    Caliph of the United States of America,      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included thismaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his ownorganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principleof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth verycomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves roomfor very many interpretations.It is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derivedout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksterswith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And Ican take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeblesupport of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  Will I?  I think not.Why?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjectionI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express thingsin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may bequite difficult to apprehend at first.So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.I do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assessthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member ofthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, thenwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean thatthe Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Ordoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will ofuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmaticrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcaneor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are orwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrityof the organization as it stands.I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments I followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requestinga Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participatingin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the GnosticMass well enough for my tastes. This doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on mylimited contact with other members.I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are manyways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved withthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedomand the preservation of individual vision.I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in responseto other posts in this thread.Invoke me under my stars.

The Book of Esther (which I read the other day forother reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joyand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people werekilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring tomind...I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbersof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originallyintended for.That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it isjust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure inthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning inreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Manypeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their ownstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven tokill by their leaders.The point is that there are many things involved in religion that oftenlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasantside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switchingbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiestparts of Man's history.@Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideologicalsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groupswith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution tofurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that thesewere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religiouspersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them morepowerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examplesbecause there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought overreligion that he does not have many choices.Well, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom oflittle silver butter-dishes.-ciao-chris blask

Severalpeople responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated exactly what I am looking for.I'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a hostvia RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and requireabout 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lotsof people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to beinterfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to usean 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then transfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROMneeds to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytesto/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS).Everything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much forthis application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UARTbuilt-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a company that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain circuitry I can use?  Thanks in advance for the info.Rich

Furthermore, your D/Aconverter will probably not present you with a signal that has beencut off at 720 Hz, but will instead alias in all the higherfrequencies.  (Although you can definitely build a filter to overcomethat problem.)On the other hand, speech should be easily compressible.  For example,you could form power spectra, or you could simply band-pass filter andthen linearize the fourier transforms.  It won't be CD quality sound,but it'll be discernible.  The power spectrum method is very good inthat respect.  I have once programmed such a software compressor, andcompression rates of 90% with relative errors due to linearization ofless than 5% were common.  Although I must say that these were musicalsounds, not speech.Have fun.-- Stephan <neuhaus@informatik.uni-kl.de>sig closed for inventory.

Evans) writes:: : Of course, penalties will have to be changed:: : Roughing:Chauvanistic Males Being Aggressive: Slashing:Chauvanistic Males Venting Frustration: Fighting:Proof That Males Cannot Cope With Their Feelings: NO NO NO! since all the penalties fall into three classes, there shouldonly be three penalties:1. Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you   are thrown out of the game, and fined.3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.Besides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penaltiesin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,until the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was inthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.This works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the mostexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.Next, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network cantake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the networkannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, andMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened beforethe PA announcer says it.Oh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the playcannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the networkcan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has toldthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a chance of pronouncing his name right.Seriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,for the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play isso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shootingcontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their routines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periodseither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. Thegame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.The reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw incommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.On TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watchit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, thenit truly is a sad day.Enough for now.dvb

It then seems logical to purchasea simple multi-user accounting system, along the lines of DacEasy orM.Y.O.B., and fire it all up!  The 486 will more or less act as server witha report/check printer attached to it.Cable runs of 30-40 feet will be necessary for this setup.Well, this all seems too easy to me.  Would any of you network gurus outthere tell me if I am out of my mind here?  Any and all suggestions, howevertrivial, will be immensely appreciated.  My apologies if this has beenbrought up before.Thanks!John-- John E.

The established situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al.The  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever teamcould successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  didwas formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop-olistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth-er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainlydebatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de-bate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that peopleplayed hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smytheand his pals showed up.>or a standout in an existing situation than it is to be someone who creates>a new situation.

From: dyoung@media.mit.edu (David Young)Subject: Drawing Lines (inverse/xor)Organization: MIT Media LaboratoryLines: 40I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-bandboxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created acolormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the linesin a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap usingXPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stayaround when the window is refreshed.Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:   /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */   /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */   palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;   palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;   palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;   XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);   XFlush( myDisplay);   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);   XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);Then to draw I do:   XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);   XFlush( myDisplay);And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse ofwhatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  Ifthe lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines areover a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxorfunction seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases andredraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong?david

The Lord IS working in our community (the homosexual community, that is).  He'snot asking us to change our sexual nature, but He is calling us to practicethe morality that He established from the beginning.Isn't Satan having a hayday pitting Christian against Christian over any issuehe can, especially homosexuality.  Let's reach the homosexuals for Christ. Let's not try to change them, just need to bring them to Christ.  If Hedoesn't want them to be gay, He can change that.  If they are living a morallife, committed to someone of the same sex, and God is moving in their lives,who are we to tell them they have to change?That's my two cent.God Bless You AllLoisc

Plus extras like hot showers, Tours, a Concourse D'Elegance and more.  This is first time in the 49'er Rally's 20-year history that the  event is being held in Quincy.  And according to Pat Gardner, Rally Chairman, The 49'er Rally's continuing growth and the need for a larger and more complete facility led us to Quincy.  Plus we can get there on either of our two most favrite highways- Highway 70, which goes through the Feather River Canyon, or up from the South via the Northernmost part of the Gold Country's Highway 49.  Day passes will not be available and non-BMW rider must be a  pre-registered guest of a BMW rider.  The Quincy Fairgrounds is located on California State Highway 70/89, two miles South of downtown Quincy.  For pre-registration forms and additional information, write Doug Hubbard, BMW Club of Northern California, 41236 Norman Court, Fremont, CA 94539, or telephone <US> (510) 651-2195 ADDITIONAL NOTES::    This is a not for profit event and riders DO get their monies worth.   Whether you've ever attended a rally before or not This is the one   to make.  The only problem has been that there are so   many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.   Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.   For folks who have been to previous 49'er rallies at Mariposa,    Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.   There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.   Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us.    Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early   arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays   for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday   with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the   awards ceremony.     For members of the various clubs, club awards will be based on    registration declaration of affilitation.  There will of course   be the usual awards for oldest male and female rider < betting 70 +   needed to win> and youngest rider ( they get cheater permits at 15>.   and greatest distance, one up & two up and all the usual things.

This has beenan ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirementsfor many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease.Up to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to prove thatthe disease exists.This paper is noteworthy in two other regards:1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogshad episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5months after exposure.  After this period, none showed any furtherclinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  Sothese are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneousrecovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observationslonger than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn'thave the same chronicity that some see in humans.2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by thevaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they wantthe world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccineefficacy.Anyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluationsof this vaccine in the next year or so.--Jeff Parke <jeffp@pgavin1.vetmed.wsu.edu>also:   jeffp@WSUVM1.bitnet    AOL: JeffParkeWashington State University College of Veterinary Medicine class of 1994Pullman, WA  99164-7012

It might be that pre-backproblems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stancecaused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurtshim. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you'recold, its a hitch. >First, minimize movement before the swing.

He changes his stance so much, he losestrack of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good tome. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is becausehe's changed his stance so much.I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hittingall the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screwhimself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous battingpractice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouragedbad hitting habits.Russ Smith*******************************************************************************I don't know anything about X's, but I know about some O.

If it is, I wouldn't give the book,or anything in it any value whatsoever.  Klapisch wrote thebook to make money (obviously) and sensational literature isgoing to sell a lot better than what he usually writes for thepapers.  I'm not calling him a liar, but if there was any proofthat a Met player had raped a little girl before a game (letalone doing it on a regular basis) they would be in jail, notShea.For those people who do not know what the press is likein New York, it is probably more cut-throat than in just aboutany other part of the U.S.  Keith Hernandez said it very well onESPN a couple of days ago, they would much rather mention aclubhouse fight, than a two-run homer in the ninth to win agame.  I do not read Klapisch's news columns regularly, but Ido know that he has been accused before as being an instigatorthat enjoys (hopefully for only professional reasons) to drumbup a news story, even if there isn't one there.  Now as far asthe confrontation with Bobby Bonilla a few days ago, I almosttotally blame Bonilla.  No matter what a member of the pressdoes, and no matter how much of a putrid individual he mightbe, that does not give a ballplayer the right to threaten ajournalist.  Personally, I always thought that a beat writer thatalways follows a club around should report the news, but not belooking to degrade a team.  I don't know whether to blameKlapisch, because that may be the only way to keep a job in NewYork.

Givenabout $10k in lab equipment and chemicals (which are commercially available)and given the knowledge that I have (graduating BS, Ch, 1993) I could synthesize enough of these compounds to make a serious dent in the populationof several major US cities.  As also noted, the knowledge is there forthe production of nuclear weapons.  It's not even that restricted.  Theonly thing is the expense.  Now I'm not going around making these things, but it's not 'cause of anylaw; I simply don't get any marginal benefit out of killing anyone.  Anylaw you enact in this respect is only going to give you the ability to add a charge against someone who does make and use said weapons.  In thecase of chemical agents, I seriously doubt that you would even know thatsomeone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used.  Part of the trouble with the chemical-weapons ban treaty between the USand the USSR is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such asGB and Sarin, etc., is that they have very valid commercial uses, and it is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacturewithout anyone knowing about it.>>< Dan Sorenson, DoD

Just wanted to glow alittle.I know what you mean!  I glow everytime Ronnie's out on the ice.In fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in personis that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probablybe seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dadstressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have tolearn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously tookthat advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrivedin Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn'tand wouldn't play a lick of defense.It's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that broughtall of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he hascertainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking atthis team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-uppermanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and itwouldn't matter.If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they wouldbe 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.

I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemedokay, but there was no sign of the internal.I installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to bootfrom it.  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquireabout the internal drive.  They either could not find it or got errors intrying to talk to it. (Silverlining claimed it was a Connor drive, but itis a Quantum... )Well, I'd backed things up, so I was able to work.  But, at some point Inoticed that the internal had reappeared.  Now, Disk First Aid says thatall's well, etc.  Things seem to be fine.But, what happened?  Was this a warning that something (the internal HDor something else) is about to die?

Thearticle included sources to contact for information on research verifyingthese statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiringabstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curriculawere found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it isreasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancyrate.The difference is not in contraceptive technology but in the values taughtto the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they havelegitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them thatthey did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is thevalues system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior ofthese kids.Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they aresuppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to thatdesired.  Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don'twe teach safe drug use to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't itbecause we know that a class in how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ touse drugs would increase drug use?  Why isn't drug abstinence educationbarred from schools because it teaches religion?

Understandably, per- haps, because if you accept that Hell is a metaphor, then you're one step closer to turning God into a metaphor as well.-- Antti Lahelma   |      mtf@saha.hut.fi            |   GNOTHI SEAUTON Lehtotie 3     -O-      stel@purkki.apu.fi          -*-  ====== ======= 00630 HELSINKI  | <<Jumalat ovat pakanoille suosiollisia>> |    TUNNE ITSESI

When Ioriginally purchased it, I experienced the failure to boot problem.  Thiswas fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard drive.Lately a similar problem has been occuring.  When the computer ispowered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am giventhe no disk to boot from icon.  However, upon turing thecomputer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine.  Furthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot button the same problem occurs.  But, as I said, turning the poweroff and on always works.This problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that beforeit often required several power off and ons to get it to boot.Does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or howit can be fixed?I'm wondering if it's getting old and requires more time to come up to speed now.  Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting thatallows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before trying to access the HD?Thanks!Altan J.

Ultra-violet (by definition?) goes from the blue end of thespectrum that people see to the radio spectrum (X-rays, cosmic rays etc).possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility (which peoplewith false eye-lenses can see easily, since it's your lenses that soak upmost of the UV), however since most people use UV to get other thingsto `glow', and the near-blue is less energetic, it would probably notwork as well, if it worked at all.

EDT          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out the first pitch.          Q  It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not Amtrack.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.          Q  George, what exactly are you prepared to do to break the logjam with  ??? Senate?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning, and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the important programs that will put people back to work right away this summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be passed.          Q  Will he compromise, that's the question?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President believes his jobs program should go forward.          Q  George, would the President be willing to accept $8 billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise being offered by --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right now, let's see what happens today.          Q  Would he go that far -- no matter what the Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per year?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's see what happens.          Q  It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order to get a vote?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative activity over the last few days.          Q  So, you'll need to compromise to get your package through?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.          Q     prepared to compromise --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting with Senator Dole.           Q  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.          Q  How?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by $500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that he is not succeeding overall.          Q  He can't beat this, can he?          Q  The fact is they can do that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop action.  There's no question about that.          Q  What are you going to do about it?          Q  George, what do you know about these alleged notes taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that when they say yes they mean no?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.          Q   Are you saying that the President said that when the Japanese say yes they mean no?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.          Q  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and there appears to be --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up but I'm not positive.          Q  George, was the specific comment that was made specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general observation on Japanese etiquette?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --          Q  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, when the Japanese say yes they mean no.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.          Q  Was he saying it facetiously first?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual observation.          Q  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but I'm not sure exactly how many.          Q  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no      MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is on.          Q  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to hear that.          Q  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S. policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.          Q     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, Saddam can't stay in office?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will continue to demand it.          Q  And are you concerned the Iran will become the dominant power in the area --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping support of terrorism.          Q  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you base that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding armaments.          Q  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he would be out of power?     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make it more difficult for him to stay in power.          Q  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical difference with you that's in good faith?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.            Q  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.          Q     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it through?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.          Q     going to rethink the way you attempt to get other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of the summer?          Q     work with Republicans and try to woo some Republicans into your camp?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the President's intiatives?          Q  But on this one -- how are you going to do it differently than you did it on this one because on this one you really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?  Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for particular votes?  When you have to go through --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the President's going to continue to reach out when he can.          Q  You don't have any regrets then about the way you have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this experience?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.          Q  They're being denied any other legislative means of putting their proposals forward.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --          Q     any ideas.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.          Q     to present them.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean they get the votes --          Q     that theirs can be passed though by the parliamentary rules under which they're playing.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.          Q  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?          Q     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about anything recently.          Q     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around the California economic situation, including the situation in Los Angeles.            I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to watch it.          Q  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball management.  Does the President have a position on that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the President intends to continue to go to the ball game.          Q  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see Reverend Jackson while he's out there?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said, even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.          Q  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball game?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the President read it.          Q  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be there, and is he going to meet with the President?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.          Q  What is the Mubarak schedule?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice President Gore.          Q  And joint statements tomorrow --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, yes.          Q  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist activities?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.          Q  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in their attempts to get some kind of action.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate action.  But there was no specific information on this specific operation at all.          Q  So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in not pursuing some kind of --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.          Q  What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing mention in the news conference yesterday --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your question.          Q  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what does the U.S. do next?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an agreement.          Q  George, why do you think sanctions is still an option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When does no mean no and you have to do something different?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.          Q  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something that is under consideration.          Q  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's condition, how he's doing?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.          Q  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning after the Mubarak visit.          Q  Is he going somewhere for Easter?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.          Q  What more can you tell us about the additional aid to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the next several weeks.          Q  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude of the one announced Sunday?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the magnitude.          Q  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where do you stand on that --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a hard look at it.          Q  But they're making it up?

I'm serious; Itend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, butI'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there areany.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I canlook up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish betweenplayers who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numberswould have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, butactually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was rushed, althoughthere doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell wasgiven 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below whatyou would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs thenext year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, atage 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where hewould have been better off staying in the minor league (where he wasperformed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being rushed;Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might havebeen less likely to give up on him.Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.

The only way to avoidthis will be to try to prohibit strong encryption.I probably shouldn't say this, but they could try to detect the useof an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statisticalproperties of the plaintext.  An old-fashioned wiretap could thendetect the use of pre-encryption, which would drastically increasethe measured entropy of the input.  A countermeasure to this wouldbe to use steganographic techniques which put out voice.You can tell if the NSA built this feature in: blow on the mike, andobserve whether a band of thugs comes through your ceiling.

This form of*conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in which people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relateto one another and to God.IMHO, Watt's stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served on the board of directors for Jim Bakker's organization, during a time in which Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker in federal prison.Bobrgolder@hoh.mbl.eduJust another Baptist...

From: halsall@murray.fordham.edu (Paul Halsall)Subject: Catholic LiturgyReply-To: halsall@murray.fordham.eduOrganization: J. Random Misconfigured SiteLines: 60The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue forsome time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is asymbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe thatthe _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar,Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real,almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of realsacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by allto be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinkingprecludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, itsimply IS holy.But, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially ifwell- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likelyto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but whichcould be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means themass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the realthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn'tdare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes havebeen encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusingon _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning inliturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [orthe heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramaticexample of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment ofthe sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pitabread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands coveredin particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; butCatholics in the past would have been distraught at this realdesacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. Wetry to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniacpriest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it andstart pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience.It doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two andthree chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicatedtunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was thegenius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is onlyslightly better.What are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if itdoesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is wellprepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTWa matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It isthe attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservativeliturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily meanthe Church will be socially conservative.In NYC I can recommend:Corpus Christi - W 12st St.Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, St. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, clean, largely gayOratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautifulAvoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.Happy Easter: Christos Aneste', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is RisenPaul HalsallHalsall@murray.fordham.edu

Such extra->rational cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.As has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_and _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it isdescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replicationsdo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should beaccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, andreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.But people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazyreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are alarge part of the history of science.There are a couple of negative points to make here:1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without directverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an acceptedpart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  Whatwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medicalreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim couldlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body ofexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.(I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.I don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much lessa theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And itis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of ratherdirectly verifying the existence of qi.)2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rationalexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, andinterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoreticalcontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,petty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and whichcomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the criticalfunction of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated.The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generatepart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;that when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotatepolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version wasindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation hadled to a replicable, and important, result.This is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually noteven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When theirtheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do notconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppressthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence theythink supports their position (creationists).-- Mark A.

Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect bythe Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power ofthe Chruch to do so.Andy Byler[You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Churchestablishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath isthat it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of theceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is basedon Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus'teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worshipoccuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that thesepoints are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one moretime.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments areright, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.Accepting the principle of sola scriptura does not commit us toobeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quiteclear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement ison where the Bible would have us place the line.By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in mattersthat are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free todetermine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept thatthe Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worshipfalls into the category of items on which individual Christians or(since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free todecide.--clh]

(To>reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from>uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical>problems are notoriously problematic.)  Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement thata treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope forfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as crediblebut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who arequalified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as amathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (andoccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Muchof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized asinformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For yearsnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists tojust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some ofthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not forthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at theNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information fromsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be ofscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientificinvestigation.Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  If thishasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empiricalresearch then it can't be of any interest to us.  To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme There've got tobe controlled studies position is an NLP technique called the FastPhobia/Trauma Cure.Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim thatit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence isuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentiallya variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioraltherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  Theprocess doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need topractice it over again at home.Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was donewith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17thfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not tomake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome studywill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of thescientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance.) The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying We don't have any way of knowing that it's effective.  These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate as anyone could want, of course, but they say  Why should I prove your theory?  and  The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.  One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much detail as I'm capable of.)  Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's adoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about doctrinnaire attitudes about science.  Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  If so, I apologize.  --In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet

(BTW, as of acouple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is thatmost people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail-order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easilyby law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep them honest about acquiring parts. For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is aHUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily.Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these arenot as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy,then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap iton a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts,more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.Mike-- Disclaimer - These opiini^H^H damn! ^H^H ^Q ^[ .... :w  :q  :wq  :wq! ^d  ^X ^?exit X Q  ^C ^? :quitbye  CtrlAltDel   ~~q  :~q  logout  save/quit :!QUIT^[zz ^[ZZZZZZ ^vi  man vi ^@  ^L  ^[c  ^

All I can say is that I will not consume it.  Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide, so a product of itshydrolysis is going to be methanol, which can then be oxidized toformaldehyde.  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion ofaspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise,since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from othercomponents of food all the time.  In studies involving administrationof high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable.Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings,say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehydeand formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levelscan damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high dosesthe body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, onetreatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk onethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.

In the first speech on the drug issue since his innaugural,Clinton said that his planned escalation of the Drug War ``would makeeverything so far seem so half-hearted that for all practicalpurposes this war is only beginning now.'' He repeatedly emphasizedhis view that ``regardless of what has been tried, or who has triedit, or how long they've been trying it, this is Day One to me.''The audience at the convention, whose theme is ``How do we spellfiscal relief?  F-O-R-F-E-I-T-U-R-E,'' interrupted Clinton frequentlywith applause.        Clinton's program, presented in the speech, follows theoutline given in his campaign position papers: a cabinet-level DrugCzar and ``boot camps'' for first-time youthful offenders.  He did,however, cover in more detail his plans for improved enforcementmethods.  ``This year's crime bill will have teeth, not bare gums,''Clinton said.  In particular, his administration will place strictcontrols on data formats and protocols, and require the registrationof so-called ``cryptographic keys,'' in the hope of denying drugdealers the ability to communicate in secret.  Clinton said theapproach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of undergroundeconomic activity, such as ``the deficit-causing tax evaders wholive in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren.''        Clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won``because even though not everyone voted for Bill Clinton lastNovember, everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense ofurgency about fighting the drug menace.  The advocates oflegalization -- the advocates of surrender -- may be very good atmaking noise,'' Clinton said.  ``But when the American people casttheir ballots, it only proved what I knew all along -- that theadvocates of surrender are nothing more than a microscopic fringe.''

Perhaps they were strong inthe faith?---------------------------[No, I don't believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul waswriting for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jewsat the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  Thereare rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachiclaws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had toface after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted tofollow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't saythat the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that itdidn't apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5.As far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians didcontinue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus theycontinued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with GentileChristians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by theceremonial aspects of it).Jesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume thatMat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact withGentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and acouple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke7) suggest that he was a God-fearer, i.e. a Gentile who followedGod, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended byJewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such.This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing viewthat Gentiles need not accept the Law.However there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul onthe Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, wehave to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, andhow that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as Iread Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in acertain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of theabolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notesthat he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's notwhat he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily beingpresent to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's animpossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyoneagrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is thateven this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iotaor dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it'simportant that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's notthe end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in theend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  Thequoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the restof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets theLaw.  The not an iota or dot would suggest a rather literal reading,but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretationsemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonialdetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitudetowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewishdiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving atenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things thatreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups andplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people whouse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, andthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specificview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining theLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law beingsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve theceremonial law, such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quiteconcerned about maintaining moral standards.The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law beingsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believethey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul isembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in lettersresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of theLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewishceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standardsof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seemsto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals andhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were laterto give Paul so much trouble.It's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, butwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at theway terms like family values take on special meaning from thecurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying tofigure out why family values should be used as a code word foropposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  Ithink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul wasinvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish valuesthat go along with the term Law, any more than people who concernedabout the family values movement are really opposed to familyvalues.--clh]

All I can say is that I will not consume it.  [...]   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.   [Reproduced without permission]   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed underthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than ifa person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a groupof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, andsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest afterdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.   The study received widespread media attention and stirred agood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchersdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite didactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do notnecessarily go hand in hand.   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examiningthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.And after reviewing every one of them, the director of theLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns HopkinsUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase inthe amount of food eaten afterward.   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causingcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for ahost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the governmenthas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causingeverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before andafter the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirmthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why theCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged withmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association'sCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administrationhave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, aclean bill of health.   Granted, the FDA has set forth an acceptable daily intake of50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceedthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to takein 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans ofaspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligramsof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cupsof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame contentof selected foods omitted]   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay awayfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder calledphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essentialamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a childconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately causesuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people withPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and otheraspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning Phenylketonurics:Contains Phenylalanine.-Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)

It just might be a bad idea for them, too.OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  Theyneed a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, theynow need to    (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of       the key.Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses?Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  Stateand lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics,while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost,statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderatelyclever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buyingnew phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolenones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmittingwithout a dialing license?]There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house, how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enoughsafeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved, how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-typechip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the FederalGovernment, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic ofthe projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of these kinds of problems will be open for public or expert scrutiny?]  Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around, even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:    (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and       turns the results over to the NY State Police.But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a ClintonAid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf wargoing on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case.Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have anextra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as anotherbargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.I understand that (legal) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain. Inscenario (b), who pays the bill?+========================================================================+|  dwight tuinstra             best:  tuinstra@sandman.ece.clarkson.edu  ||                         tolerable:  tuinstrd@craft.camp.clarkson.edu   ||                                                                        ||        Homo sapiens: planetary cancer??  ...

This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada'sviolent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the U.S.  (Ournon-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate).  Itwould seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of guncontrol laws.       I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural andenforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and thenthat reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.>Given that most>criminally used guns are either legally purchased or stolen from those who>purchase them legally, having more restrictions on legal possession does >seem to have the effect of reducing gun-related crimes.         Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punishedbecause somebody might steal something from me and go and commit acrime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address thequestion of Canada.

(Well, it makes sense to some of us, anyway.  ;-)       The other side of the coin, of course, is that far illegal drugsare purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally. I've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminalshave shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources(stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simplysee South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns aswell, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.>>If you would just look a little closer at the crime statistics, you would>>realize that:>>  -our non-gun crime rate is also very high, so guns per se are not the issue>>Directly contradicted by the NEJM study that compared crime in Seattle and>Vancouver, B.C.  The non-gun rates were roughly the same for both cities.  The>difference in violent crime rates was almost totally gun-related.          And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiquesof it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel cometo mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almostentirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketedfor poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when youcompared the white majority they were virutally identical.        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs.non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relativeconditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage ofnomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take intoaccount that the non-whites in either city were not living in thesame conditions.        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which arearguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a farhigher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not onlynot significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightlylower.>>  -violent crime is highly concentrated in the inner city>>Surprise.  Pick the area with the highest incidence of poverty, drug use, disease,>etc.  Since rates are lower in suburbia, us middle class folks can ignore the>problem.       The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. inner-cityproblems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a conditionwhich is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violentcrime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun controlis the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As oneCanadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun controlin 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increasein violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparentlythey didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime inthe early eighties.>>  -most violent crime occurs in areas with strict gun control already>>Post hoc ergo propter hoc.  Those areas implemented gun control because of>the high rates.         True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., wheregun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but thatcrime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was highor low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impactviolent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than itwas going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate bysaying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be institutedto deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, youcan't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause ofthat gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun controlwas implemented, just as happened in Canada.>Similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control.       As would be expected if violent crime was generally independentof gun control.>And the jury is still out on the question of whether recent tough laws in >Washington D.C. may have alleviated violence and suicide rates there.

I've noticed that when Igo out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants, I will usually geta slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards.  This happens to manyof my friends and relatives too.  And, heh, we eat Chinese food all thetime at home :) (but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves)So, when we put one and one together, it can be safely assumed thatMSG may cause some allergic reactions in some people.Stick with natural things.  MSG doesn't do body any good (and possiblyharms, for that matter).  So, why bother with it?

We are capable of rejecting God's love but He never fails to love us.These verses do not show that God's love is qualified but rather that He is opposed to evil.I am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be an innappropriate emphasis on Hell.  God deserves our love and worship because of who He is.  I do not like the idea of frightening people into accepting Christ.  I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows God's love with putting into words and explaining that love.

Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations toClose Naval, Marine Reserve Centers To: National Desk, Defense Writer Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of          the United States, 202-479-2258   WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve OfficersAssociation of the United States has alerted the Defense BaseRealignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to givesufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.   In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members ofCongress with affected locations in their constituencies, includingSen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine listignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly priorservice personnel.   ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),suggested concern that the only plausible alternative is that theyare intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reservecomponents from maintaining even today's relatively low level ofparticipation in their parent service's Total Force of the future.   He asked the commission to remove from consideration alllocations without sufficient and convincing demographic data towarrant approval of the requested action.   Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserveinstallations on this list are large enough to have a significantimpact on the community, if closed, wrote Hultman.  The majorissue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a largepercentage of the existing locations.   Hultman reminded the commission, The fact that the vastmajority of the Reserve installations on this list do not comeclose to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in thisprocess certainly supports the thesis that these actions aresimply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy andMarine Corps Reserve.   ROA also noted that at the end of the 1960s, when the number ofNaval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480Naval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations areapproved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations rangingfrom South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 NavalReserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., toMissoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps ReserveCenters include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind.,Billings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technologydemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)rocket ship.        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White SandsMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start inmid-June.        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast forSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of afollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required fora sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister governmentagencies.        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs fororbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recentchanges in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTOless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X asa step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,said Col.  Simon Pete Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Wordendeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for theprogram. I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money Ihave available to spend, he quipped at a press conference at McDonnellDouglas Astronautics headquarters.        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbitalobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the better,faster, cheaper approach to hardware development.  The agency believesthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that leapfrog ahead ofevolutionary technology developments.        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a build a little, test alittle approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He saidthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --showed how today's engineers could move beyond the miracles of ourparents' time.        The key is management, Worden said. SDIO had a very light handon this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden saidlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will becrucial. It's essential we do not end up with a large managementstructure where the price goes up exponentially.        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of theHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. This is the directionwe're going to have to go, said Rep.  George Brown, the committee'sDemocratic chairman. Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren'tsustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.Joking that a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if itwere left to the civil space agency.        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnellDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-stagedrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. Let's notbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said theprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with itsC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautiousabout a large private secotro commitment. On very large ventures,companies put in seed money, said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'senior vice president for space systems. You need strong governmentinvestments.        While the government and industry continue to differ on fundingfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach todevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to DouglasAircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way forthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry couldeventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will expand the envelopeof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  Thefirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticletake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000feet.        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The finaltests will include a pitch-over manever that rotates the vehicle backinto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles PeteConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehiclesaircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automatedcheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology willbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than thePratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquidhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds ofthrust        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 modelhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-onthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapidturnaround.        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employtri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff andthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt hasa technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsiblefor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.

On the other hand,>an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes.There are a lot of people running around saying God told me this and God told me that these days.  Some people really have heard God, and othersheard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  Hesaid someone told him, The Lord gave me a song.  He said that it wasthe worst song he had ever heard.I know why he gave you that song, Murillo said, He didn't want it anymore.But God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to theidea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spiritin the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the firstto put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the onewe have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.For example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an M whoprophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecyhe gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other propheciesbecause the king complained before he heard the prophecy, He never prophesiesanything good about me.  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples.Barnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an apostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two ofAgabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophetbefore he gave them.  So prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it Scripture.  >Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new>but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call>that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldn't that be more having to do with>knowledge?I don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with prophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also similar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets propheciesin a seemingly prophetic way, for example, And his bishoprick let anothertake concerning Judas office.A clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying aboutwhat will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joelabout the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scripturalprophecy can be used in later prophecy.  Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdomcan overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are oftenconsidered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a bit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able tolabel a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the Spirit, and use them according to His leading.Link Hudson.

At a tuned engine rpm, thestacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the airrushing in.Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum ofthe air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way insidelong after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke.Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air fromescaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansionchambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing)to the air in motion.

I, in particular, think the basic ideas ofhomeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.  What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things(including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientificattention.  If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do notuse the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what iseffective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For allof current science is based on the past work of scientists whosemethodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.  It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examinethose results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It isalso true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualified to do so credibly.  But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies iscapable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that noideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possiblybe worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude asdoctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief inreason.  --In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet

That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something   they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be   verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the   chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the   output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output   bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.   If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that   some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that   they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,   DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output   change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think   NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.Consider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47, andnot using either of these bits except through this XOR. This systemmakes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search would nowonly have 2^79 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bitswouldn't turn up anything interesting.   Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see   the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased   subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.The algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb, butI'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancywhich was well-hidden, but would still make an exhaustive key searchtake far less than 2^80 encryptions. I don't believe your claim thatthe real keysize can be verified externally.Andy Lattoandyl@harlequin.com

Your aggressions thru>Turkey at anytime in the past did not get you any reward and shall>not get you anywhere.Don't swallow propaganda as truth Sir. British promised to Venizelos(greek PM) that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will begiven to Greece, _if_ he will agree to drag Greece in the side ofthe British during the WWI (because the greek King was proGerman).The British succeeded by bombarding Athens (1916), killing quite a few,forcing abdication of the King, division of Greece into two separatestates (North-South), and finally laying the ground for the most disasterousdivision between greeks for our century.(So don't feel bitter that theAllies gave any green light because they liked us....)Anyway, the British succeed to establish Venizelos, war starts at a secondfront against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the warin the East against the Russians, and finally the WWII came in an end.After that the British (and French) forgot immediately their promises(as usually). Even though publicly they say that they support the Greekcause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usualreasoning and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they graduallybackup Kemal (who had given now to the British water and bread thathe will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a smallethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the planto keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansioninto warm-water facilities. The greek empire being an Orthodox Christianstate was too prone to become Russian client.Out of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on ourlands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true Giants by theBritish, since they worked to realize their goals in the region.Under the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of bigmilitary funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russianbuffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. becauseotherwise the use of terror of changing the balance of power in the Aegeanwill be used.Under the same exact rational you should see the Cyprus problem.GrPS: I don't make any anti-...whatever rhetoric. This is the situation    in our region and needs to be said. The previously mentioned powers    are not anything special; they are fucntioning the same way which    anyone else functions all throughout history. So I don't selectively    single them out; just they are relevant to _our_ current afairs.

Find another way.You know, in many ways this might be just the kick we need to straightenthings out in this country.  Also, people would have a need to replaceguns with something else, perhaps deadly sprays that would make Mace and OCseem like water.  They would be lighter and easier to conceal.Guns are really old in design and as long as we have tons of them, no oneis motivated to design something better.  I'm sure we could come up withsome real nasty stuff if we tried and getting rid of these guns would getus moving on this track asap.  This is what we really want, right?  Stuffthat's smaller, lighter and far more deadly.Remember, in this country we'll really scramble to accomplish impossiblefeats if we are motivated enough and I think self-defense is high on ourlist of motivators.

They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust'is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burntalive as can be seen below.Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion,also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arenawas left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this centurycommitted by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred.The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain forhumanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German,Austrian, French and American authorities.Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of the victims of these cruelties can be heard.Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).

Although two months have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at  almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people  well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun. They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the  Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.  I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is  destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are  speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as  well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is  proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.

For 99.9% of the things youcan plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers theywere a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memoryperiodically.With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should beless of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longerrecommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for theirequipment.

Just as we have seen in the past withblue box technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones,we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market forstolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakescriminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stoleninstruments.Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days,a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be acontinuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.In other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn acurrent inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, andpersistent threat to the general public.On the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to adevice in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at leaststand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.Finally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting inrealtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments,there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communicationsin the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered,and the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording andarchiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasibleacross the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.  The existence of theserecordings could open up vast potential for abuse.Brad Yearwood    brad@optilink.com     {uunet, pyramid}!optilink!bradPetaluma, CA

The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to    150MPH.)    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum    per-tire loads:    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at    all.    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.Q:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put    normal tires on the car?A:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.Q:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side    of my car?A:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.Q:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the    car should I put them on?A:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.Radar Detectors and Speed Limits:Q:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits    in this Q&A posting?A:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.Safety Equipment:Q:  Do airbags really work?A:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.Brake Questions:Q:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas    always wants to do this.A:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,    or badly grooved.Q:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is    this really a good idea?A:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a    car with an automatic to take the test.Q:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?A:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.Q:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?A:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where    most of the corrosion occurs.    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the    economics are questionable for street use.    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little    information at this time.Q:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs    more.  Is it worth it?A:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original    equipment or OE-equivalent components.    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this    eventuality.    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an    ABS system in your car.    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid    becomes very important.Q:  What about this threshold braking business?A:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is    needed here -- rpw]    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're    not very near the threshold.    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS    take over.    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at    the pedal will be sufficient.    Gas Questions:Q:  Does High Octane gasoline help?A:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car    needs.Q:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?A:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not    actually require leaded gasoline.Q:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?A:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected    cars.    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything    in your gas tank.    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,    once every six months, is highly recommended.Q:  What about detergent gasolines?A:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.Lubrication Questions:Q:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?A:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.Q:  Are `quick lube' places any good?A:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on    your wallet at all times.Q:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?A:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.Q:  Do synthetic oils really work?A:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty    as conventional oils.    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.Q:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.    How often should I change my oil?A:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out    of storage.Misc. Questions:Q:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they    break.  What's the story?A:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water    pump can be a costly mistake.)Q:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?A:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance    oriented vehicles.Q:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?A:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator    is probably the cause.-- richard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith

From: jemurray@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (John E Murray)Subject: quality of Catholic liturgyOrganization: The Ohio State UniversityLines: 37I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering mywife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, Catholic liturgy.  In the last fewyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It'sdriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition isthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.Lately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportionof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do(which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing.Example.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usuallyon Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, takingthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we sayCrucify him we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do itagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were invited to sitduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian invitation, I was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seemstypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward themusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of theliturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to beexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're justsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is aboutto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of layexperts, but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has abias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact ofbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier forpeople to be aware of the Lord's presence.So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Massgoing down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday orFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregationalparticipation in Catholic Masses lately?John Murray

LabsLines: 50I am working on a project to provide an emergency managementinformation system.  In keeping with more classic command andcontrol type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitorsystem in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.  I have a number of X level questions regarding this:(We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be predominantly Sun's, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well).I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configuredsuch that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens,and not multiple X displays.   Given this:- Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simpleas tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There'snothing special that needs to be done to shift focus betweenscreens?- Do I have to run separate window managers on the separatescreens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?What are they; who sells them...- Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab awindow frame and move a window from one screen to the next?- Is there any way for the application to transparently seemultiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardwareonly provide for each screen to start at 0,0?- Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing asystem capable of using either multiple screens or a singlescreen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulatemultiple screens instead)?  I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can relyon providing config files which will specify for eachconfiguration the screen placement of each window in theapplication.  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experienceare more than welcome.========================================================================Jo Pelkey                                   Phone: (509)375-6947Battelle Pacific Northwest Labs             Fax:   (509)375-3641Mail Stop K7-22                             Email: je_pelkey@pnl.govP.O.

You are probably thinking of Church of God inChrist, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.2)  I'm not sure what you mean by signifying believers  but itshould be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has itever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian. The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain isthat speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becominga Christian in which one is Baptized in the Holy Spirit  That may bewhat you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals arefrequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in orderto be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not themajority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage inMark 16 about these signs following them that believe but they generallydo not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren'tsaved.3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement thathas such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty biggeneralizations here.  Do Neo-Pentecostals only believe in tongues as asign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message? I've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized themas believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues asa sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not beinclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend,they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will becharismatic.Ken BannerDept. of Religious StudiesUniversity of Pennsylvaniakbanner@philae.sas.upenn.edu

Local law enforcement will be unable to performa wiretap without bringing in federal agencies.   Based on the (possiblyincomplete) understanding of the system quoted from D. Denning, only theFBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer, which seemsto be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request.  This movesa great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level.The reason I like this point is that it may sway or even persuadepeople who don't generally line up with the civil liberties crowd.

I occasionally findcorrupted files, but most of the time programs work fine. Are there any utilitiesthat are easily available that can help me determine whether or not the problemis a result of the hard drive vs an ill-behaved program or some other hardwareitem? Are there utilites to determine whether or not the hard drive is properlyaligned etc? As might be expected, I would greatly appreciate any help on thismatter. I'm considering just reformatting the disk and reinstalling everything(and hoping that will fix the problem), but I would like to have some assuranceof what the problem cause is. Also, can someone give me an opinion on DOS 6.0? Are the compression anddefragmentation routines good enough to consider the upgrade if I don't havethose routines already (as opposed to buying them separately)? Much thanks in advance for any help.Mitchel Soltyssoltys@radonc.unc.edu

I will not comment on thevalue or lack of value of Elias's proposal.  I just want to saythat it is very distressing that at least two people here areprofoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine.  They were NOTlike Elias's idea, they were more like the opposite.  Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted,and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies wereconsidered not pure Gypsies but mongrels formed from the pure Gypsy race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.  It is also true that towards the end of WWII even the purist Gypsies were hunted down as the theory was forgotten.Brendan.(email:  bdm@cs.anu.edu.au)

Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - Isaid the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a resultof it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  I never said anything about which sidewould be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of theconflict than any psychological factors.  I think there is no doubt that despitethe fact we intervened in Somalia, the level of attention devoted to there wasconsiderably less than what is devoted to Bosnia, if the newspapers and tv newsI see are any guide.Dave

From: hbrooks@uiatma.atmos.uiuc.edu (Harold_Brooks)Subject: RBI, RISP, and SLGOrganization: Bill's Safety Cab and Record Bar, Chickasha, OKLines: 49Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs andrelated topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can predict a player's RBIs using information about his overallperformance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP)that he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculatedpredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'dtake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit tothe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's thatI've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them andb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If yourun a simple least squares fit to the data you get (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which issignificant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like thefit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts thelow HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or itcould just be Ozzie.  The results:                           RBI-HR         Years        Actual   PredictedCarter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) thatRBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overalland how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.More later,Harold-- Harold Brooks                    hbrooks@uiatma.atmos.uiuc.eduNational Severe Storms Laboratory (Norman, OK)I used to work for a brewery, too, but I didn't drink on the job.-P.

He couldn't hit abull in the ass with a banjo!! Al must remember a few years back when Mick scored 3 goals in one period against the Caps in a 5-3 Isles win. I was thereand was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later he'sgotten worse. He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up gettingstupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!!As for Pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He eithermakes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can'tstay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or committs a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!!As far as the playoffs, the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps.Two good teams with talent but so inconsistent. They should meet in the firstround. The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so theyshould play well against Jersey tonite. It'll probably be another tight 1-goalgame as the last 20 games hve been for the Isles. I wish when the get a leadthey could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensiveshell and letting the opposition get back in the game. Al MUST understand hecan't do with this team what he did with the 80-83 Isles. maybe Al should gotto. Where is Bobby Nystrom?? Clark Gilles?? John Tonelli?? These are the kindof young minds we need behing the bench!!    FIRE AL!!!!John ScialdoneSCIALDONE@NSSDCA.GSFC.NASA.GOV**********When your ship comes in, first man takes the Sail********************

The clinic was open till 6:00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told the doctor that we were there, and came back and told us the doctor would not see us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayed here.  During the next few minutes, in response to my questions, with several trips to the back room, the receptionist told me:- the doctor was doing paperwork in the back,- the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going  to the emergency room;- the doctor would not even speak to me;- she would not tell me the doctor's name, or her own name;- when asked who is in charge of the clinic, she said I don't know.I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room, butI was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want tobe bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  I'm still trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a letter.   We will certainly never set foot in that clinic again.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Mary Ryanmryan@stsci.eduSpace Telescope Science InstituteBaltimore, Maryland

But I am still pretty pissed of at thelocal ABC coverage. They cut off the first half hour of coverage by playingDavid Brinkley at 12:30 instead of an earlier time slot. I don'teven understand their problem. If they didnt think enough people wouldnot watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game? Andif they showed the remaining 2.5 hours of the game, would it hurt to playDavid Brinkley at its regular time? They dont have any decent programmingbefore noon anyway. I called the sports dept and blasted them on theirmachine. I called gain and someone picked it up. When I asked him why theypremepted the first half hour of the Stanley Cup playoffs, he seemed a bitconfused. When I explained a bit more in detail, he then said that's uptoto our programming dept. call back on  Monday. weel, I understand that thesports dept is not responsible for this preemption. BUt I can't understandhow someone in the sports dept. can't even recognise the name of playoffsshown on the very same station he works for.Anyway, I am going to call them tomorrow and blast them on the phone again.I urge all Atlanta hockey fans to call WSB 2 and ask them not to do thesame thing for the next 4 weeks.-Pravin Ratnam(Oh by the way, Pens rule!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. My bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung suchthat they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on thelower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a bank-follower, or alittle stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7mm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for themystery.The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'mfairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end ofthe footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread inthe hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of somethinghaving been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.  Okay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can yourip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) withoutdamaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingothat Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenlychanges phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid?  I'm quite amazed at how this could have happened.  In the meantime, lifegoes on, without a left-hand bank-follower.Barry Manor DoD

Investigation showed that some Xservers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window, whileothers return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thingto me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware -a Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK, while aSun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior onNCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs. Actually, the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the rootwinodw are gladly returned as OK. Is XQueryBestCursor semi-broken or is thisbehavior correct?

I am as concerned about the media's complicity in thisgrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, theinvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away fromany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had beenbehind it.  What's going on here?Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.I'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-opsbecause I've found some of the techniques to be useful in businessnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEURknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do apsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI hadprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior wasemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away fromcivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve theirisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religiousorientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault asthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to beingconsumed in the apocalypse.IMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentratedpsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course ofaction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publiclyappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered thetanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.They KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,obstensibly to perform gas insertions (love that NewSpeak) WOULD pushhim over the edge.Look at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TVearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblicalrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Renoon Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was truethey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW theywere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational andreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, atthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back andwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with thegas insertion right up to the point where flames appeared.  The imagethat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting backand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended withoutbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agencyinterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservationof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,abandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed thearmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploitedhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  Asimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tellhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could nothave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left thecompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required theFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of therevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not withoutall that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had toshow the world how big her balls are.Yesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.

If Elchibey is going to shell the Armenians of Karabakh from Aghdam, his people will pay the price! If Elchibey is going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price! If Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of Kelbajar, his people will pay the price. It also seems other non-Azeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood theyare next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation. Just look at the situation with the Lezgians.About the Kurds...what Kurds! According to the Azerbaijani government, there are no Kurds in Azerbaijan. Can't they make up their minds? Oh I see, there are only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds! And anyway, this 60 Kurd refugee story, as have other stories, are simple fabrications sourced in Baku, modified in Ankara. Other examples of this are Armenia has no border with Iran, and the ridiculous story of the intercepting of Armenian military conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by somebody unknown, from Armenian into Azeri Turkish, submitted by an unnamed special correspondent to the NY Times from Baku. Real accurate![h]       However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane [h]       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one[h]       that happened last SUMMER.

The content of[HE]of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not[HE]humanitarian aid.....Your facts in error. Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey have been either searched, re-routed or confiscated. Some American planeswere searched, others were re-routed, others were untouched. Rail shipments were held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkeyfor the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia. Wheat wasconfiscated, other shipments were exchanged with crap and dirt, thenshipped to Armenia. U.S. planes don't have to use Turkish air bases. The U.S.uses these bases to bomb Iraq. Anyway, U.S. planes can fly over Georgia, whichthey have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed anything other than a paranoid Turkish military. [HE]Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about.[HE]since it's content is announced to be weapons? Well, big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijanfrom Turkey, yet Demirel and others say no.

I don't remember which one it is off ofthe top of my head, but it basically goes like this: Jesus is talking with theapostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can come,Elijah must first come. Jesus replies that Elijah has come, but they did not recognize him. It then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering toJohn the Baptist. This seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation.

Jesus is the head of the body, the church   B.  You cannot say yes to Jesus, but no to the churchEphesians 2:19-22   A.  The church is the family of God   B.  The church is based on the Word of God only          Cornerstone=Christ          Foundation= Apostles=New Testament                      Prophets=Old Testament  (see Revelation 21:9-14)1 Corinthians 12:12-13   A.  Baptism is when we become a member of the churchAs for the question of denominations:   A.  The Bible teaches that there is only ONE church from Ephesians4:4-6, Romans 12:4-5, 1 Corinthians 12:12-13   B.  1 Corinthians 1:10-13 says that there should be no divisions inthe church.  There should be no following of personalities in the church(and in time, their writings)   C.  There are so many churches today because of a problem.  2 Timothy4:1-4 says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find achurch that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyleHebrews 10:24-25   A.  Do not miss church   B.  Purpose is to encourage each other, so we will remain faithful.Involved on a relationship level in the church   C.  Must come to ALL servicesAnother verse which is helpful is Hebrews 3:12-15.  The church should beencouraging daily, as it is their duty to do.Of course, more standards apply:   1 Timothy 4:16  People in the church should be watching their livesand doctrines to make sure they both live up to the Word entirely (ie,disciples).   Acts 17:10-12  The pastor does not come close to the Apostle Paul(natural conclusion since the Apostle Paul talked with Jesus directlyface to face), so if the Bereans, who were considered noble, didn't takePaul at his word but checked out what he said with Scripture to verifyhis statements, then church members are to do the same and verify thepastor's statements.  If they are not verifiable or valid in light ofother verses, then that group should be avoided as a church (would'vemade a wonderful suggestion to the Waco group, especially in light ofMatthew 24).Joe Fisher

In addition, it requirs anyonewith a used car dealer's license to own at least 10 cars at a time, all thetime. Let me continue with this example and try to answer Steve's questions.Steve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resellcars.  Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bumpup against these limits, or you would like to do it full-time but thesestupid, arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pullingyourself up.  So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willingto take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs, and you'reprotected from doing what you want with your life.Here's what I see libertarianism offering you:Your money is truly yours; it belongs to you.  You can use it to buy a car.If you use it to buy a car, it is truly your car; it belongs to you.  Youcan use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car, you can sellthat car.Your life is truly yours; it belongs to you.  It matters not if someonethinks that it's wrong for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 monthsrather than, say, 9 cars.  They may dissaprove, but it is not their life ortheir money, it is your life and your money.My money is truly mine; it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car.Perhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewheredissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.That someone could go to the government and insist that the government makeus stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doingwhat we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression.And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other.This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decencyand common sense.  A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty.And yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving orrejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike meas a wonderful way to improve the human condition.

Horror stories about thecontents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underagedmodels) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletinalready raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only onestep removed from the old crypto-wielding child molester argument.  AnEFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by theconnection to child pornography and the like.Similarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  Inlight of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate itstands to be labelled as communist, anarchist hackers, radical, etc.  I don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for SocialResponsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hystericalantinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome politicalbaggage.Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptographywould best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existinggroup, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited toadvocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein'squestion: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you goingto do about it?Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations,I would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction:gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of theissue as well as the First-Amendment side.Tal  kubo@math.harvard.edu

Let's assume a brute-force engine like thathypothesized for DES:  1 microsecond per trial, 1 million chips.  That's10^12 trials per second, or about 38,000 years for 2^80 trials.  Well,maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond, and builda machine with 10 million chips.  Sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution.IDEA uses 128-bit keys.  Shall I bother doing the calculations for you?Hint:  multiply 3.8 years by 2^(128-80).  And you can't do IDEA at thatspeed; key setup takes much too long.  I wouldn't be surprised if thatwere the case for Skipjack, too, though there's no way of knowing justyet.  DES used only xor because that's what was feasible with mid-70'stechnology.

In order to turn thespacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will beavailable, or you need to retrain a new team.Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed.Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set.Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a standby mode foruse in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is stillrequired to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance isrelatively cheap.Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenanceto stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin-stabilized control mode because it would require little power or maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from timeto time.In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.David W. @ GSFC

From: betz@gozer.idbsu.edu (Andrew Betz)Subject: Randy Weaver trial update: Day 5.Nntp-Posting-Host: gozerOrganization: SigSauer Fan Club Lines: 94Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate televisionstation, KTVB Channel 7.Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.Monday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.Synopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified thatRandy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the NationalFirearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodgeasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire becauseof possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparentlyended without further incident, as it was mentioned neitherby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns personnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting asan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearmsin his dealings with Randy Weaver.Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at anAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The twothen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation intime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weaponstransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, He felt like he(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for theWhite cause.The two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant andlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this secondmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device totape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gaugeshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrellength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaveris reported to have said that he could perform better work oncehis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibilityof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollarsfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fiftydollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could havesimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).The next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated thathis source had only come up with one hundred dollars insteadof the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaversuspected he was dealing with an informant, I had a guy inSpokane tell me you were bad.  Fadeley managed to convinceWeaver otherwise.The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes weremade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of thesemeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ alsoreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving VickiWeaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There musthave also been phone taps.These tapes were played to the court via both headphones andloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver'sattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted tomake sure that the government proved its case, ...if it has acase at all... according to the rules.Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard hiswife's voice on the tape.U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hearaccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on theWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affectthis trial is not explained.Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerningKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they aresurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they weresurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustainedin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when RandyWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported thatHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a reportthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aimingat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Criticsare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate theonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver andDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe thatHarris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.Tuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. Kenneth Fadeley's testimony is scheduled to continue.

I recall, before we did anything for Somalia, (apparent) left-wingers sayingthat the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than toSomalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans considerunworthy of help.  They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops tothe opposite place than that predicted by the theory.For that matter, this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want tohelp the Serbs.  After all, they're Christian, and the Muslims are not.  Ifthe desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that areless like us, why does everyone _want_ to help the side that _is_ less like us?Especially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think?--On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to me...

For example, is this a public key systemor a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how thesystem could work (given that the keys are tied to the device andnot the person).Further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks.I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunksand a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic.I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system,but it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the real 80-bit key.Philip

SPACE BILLBOARDS!

NASA has taken the firsteps toward this hideous vision of the future.  Observers werestartled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at thepad with SCHWARZENEGGER painted in huge block letters on theside of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arrangedfor the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketingis working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers ona plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earthorbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However,since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates(WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. Thismay look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO ofSpace Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of theproject is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozonemonitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs...........What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalizethe night sky?

The government provides free health care to all U.S. >residents. And there are no out-of-pocket costs. Wrong.  In better EC countries that use pure (but public) healthinsurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-likesocialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementaryinsurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 editionhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital andbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  Thepublic insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amountfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket oraccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds ofFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of healthcosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from othertaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expendituresfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figurefor the U.S.That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fundis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such backin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real healthinsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoffof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly libertarianfaction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but thatjust a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the averageCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their Americancounterparts on issues like these).I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget aboutleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadiannewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100%insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't knowit, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (Americanconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones whoseriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about theAmericans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germanswho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things thatshouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals forinsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason thatthe Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despitebeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge tospend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're adifferent culture.>Like the play or pay model, managed competition leaves in place two >elements of the current health care system that reformers most often >criticize: the private, for-profit insurance industry; and the >employer-based system of coverage.

Managed Care relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most westernnations that use only public health insurance like Canada, Franceand Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be saysof HMO/NHS approaches, We left that behind with East Germany!).Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers stranglingdoctors with budget strings.In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in Franceand Germany, with all private doctors and both private and publichospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisionsare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinkedsickness funds over a century old while Canada divides by theirprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with thedoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is

Wisconsin - In a referendum up against all odds, the determinedefforts of the Madison Area Citizens Against Crime paid off on April6 when a nonbinding referendum banning the possession of handguns inMadison, Wisconsin, was defeated.  Despite opposition to the ban --aired largely by firearms owners at a series of public meetings onthe issue -- the Common Council voted on February 17 to place thereferendum on the ballot, allowing only seven weeks of campaigning toreverse public opinion on the controversial issue. An October 1992 poll conducted by the Wisconsin State Journal found57% in support and 38% opposed, with 5% expressing no opinion.  Byelection day, of the more than 56,000 voters who went to the polls,51% cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49% voted tohave the Madison Common Council enact such a ban.  The campaigncommittee, spearheaded by the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement and NRA-ILA,relied on neighborhood canvassing, direct mail and radio/TVadvertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implicationsraised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved. Despite the surprising defeat, it is expected that the Madisoninitiative's chief proponent, Mayor Paul Soglin, will attempt to havethe Common Council enact an ordinance banning handguns.

Keywords: science   errors   Turpin  Organization: University of Hawaii (Mathematics Dept)Expires: Mon, 10 May 1993 10:00:00 GMTLines: 80Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. And in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a  perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house.  In science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata --- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since they lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of a rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made.  In article <1993Apr14.171230.16138@kestrel.edu> king@reasoning.com     (Dick King) writes:>  [ Somebody writes: ]>>I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....>  ....>He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a>universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not.>         ....>Einstein played by the rules, which demand that hypotheses only be put out>there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them.These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med andsci.psychology.  According to these posters  If it's not supported bycarefully designed controlled studies then it's not science.Taken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science.  For one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, it is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment --- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come with anything worthwhile.  Furthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think isone of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigatequestions because they can be readily handled by the currentlyfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutionalor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention tothose questions which seem to have fundamental significance.For instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated withstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in manyareas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papersresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questionsinto a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin'sassertion that current scientific methods avoid all known errors.)I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.  --In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet

Fact is SCSI-2 controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device{As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vsIDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the 20%faster then IDE came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe itwas there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing withSCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 devicewith a SCSI-2 controller chip.SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips{becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bitmode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of courcethe prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips{or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTHworlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware(port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO createsa logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes.When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that thearticle knows what it is talking about {even if it does not tell HOW thefigures came about} while  DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu is throwing outranges that don't tell SQUAT {Since he IGNORES SCSI-1 devices withSCSI-2 chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended.} }

In addition, people often request information which hasbeen posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, thealt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the followingtitles:   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument   5.

The articles titled A Primer on How to Work Withthe Usenet Community, Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenetand Hints on writing style for Usenet are particularly relevant.  Questionsconcerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the FindingStuff section below.

Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute themto anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to theauthor, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; itdoes nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floatingaround the network.                                Finding StuffAll of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here aresome suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with   Alt.Atheism FAQ:.2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the   problem.3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest   versions of the FAQ files there.   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq   in the body.4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article   Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup carries a list of these   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu   consisting of the following lines:      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of   the following lines:      send atheism/faq/faq.txt      send atheism/faq/logic.txt      send atheism/faq/intro.txt      send atheism/faq/resource.txt   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.   There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are help and   send atheism/index.6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have    FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.mathewÿ

What the Hellis he thinking.Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commentedhow fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be aregular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt, But torre saidhe liked Gilkey coming off the bench.

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.  The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password  and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full  descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli  [BER91].  Chris Galas writes: ``Someone awhile back was looking for a way to  decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.   There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,  Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will  decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox  files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you  think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a  call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files  that have a 10 char or less pw key.''* How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?  A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the  plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.  If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the  following:   1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.  (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of  the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.   If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something  over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different  key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes  of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which  indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.  2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This  removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since  English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of  text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing  plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact  one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)  If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a  standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis  texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in  the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.  See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].* How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]  Here's one popular method, using the des command:    cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail  Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called  PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through  1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.  There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this  writing.  There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting  mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own  newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ  as well.  PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm  without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)  in the USA.  RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which  is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside  the USA.  Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of  the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the  message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there  have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and  algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as  we know).* Is the UNIX crypt command secure?  No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt  breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks  on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].* How do I use compression with encryption?  A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by  some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).  Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact  distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's  impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse  characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up  more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy  has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some  redundancy in your compressed output.  Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they  have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that  actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of  UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''  that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.    This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a  bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means  removes the need for strong encryption.  Compression after encryption is silly.* Is there an unbreakable cipher?  Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the  one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as  plaintext.  Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be  useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by  likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is  expected to remain valid.* What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?  Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom  number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be  cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to  predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of  the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of  0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.  A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function  of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently  random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by  the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps  generated by a hardware random number source).  Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,  generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of  entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo  gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in  it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,  for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random  string.  When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is  important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that  because it looks complicated to a human, it must be random.  For  example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be  unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a  clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.* What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?  See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount  of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in  the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number  of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this  can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to  back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.   Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have  multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security  from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.  Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic  measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives  probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext  for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible  plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys  are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally  deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine  the likelihood of events of interest.  Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than  D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not  enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of  possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,  which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to  8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but  the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work  required to find the key after approximately D characters have been  intercepted.  In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used  in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key  size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if  it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few  practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all  manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack  some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic  considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a  recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.  Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and  information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most  promising directions.  Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information  statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal  1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the  possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].* What is key management and why is it important?  One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in  full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,  and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of  course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling  Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)  Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can  eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in  modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are  transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but  also enough key material to cover the traffic.  Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and  handling of keys.  A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology  is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use  employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key  Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that  certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control  personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and  to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the  reporting of lost CIKs.  This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management  problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,  many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''* Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?  Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from  relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a  linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random  number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds  and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a  high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically  this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for  cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more  complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---  but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable  structure at all.  See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].* What is the correct frequency list for English letters?  There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than  the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:  namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of  English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,  but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.  The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do  you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a  fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It  has changed over time; it is different between different authors.  Any particular message will have different statistics from those of  the language as a whole.  The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have  exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all  reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.  In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other  buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood  estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a  text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with  reasonably robust answers.  So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will  be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.* What is the Enigma?  ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of  information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by  the British during WWII.''  See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].* How do I shuffle cards?  Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of  values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output  permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you  need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly  distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that  function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH  is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two  addresses given)  for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;  modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since  ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the  error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s  modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less  than y, go back and get another ranno() value.* Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?  Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with  possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted  separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps  even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.  As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard  PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the  keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be  encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in  part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one  of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.  If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must  be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in  the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.  The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the  illegal copy.* Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?  schneier@chinet.chi.il.us (Bruce Schneier) says: AccessData of Orem,  Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of  popular Macintosh and PC software packages.

What Peter says about God is whatthe Bible says.   Consider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands ofyears, various people come up and testify of their experience with theliving God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses,once the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comesDavid, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King Nebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comesNehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agenttakes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who useto kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Upcomes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself.Up comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRSagents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of yearswith people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himselfI am. While you are listening to all this stuff, you realize thatKing David could have never known John, Solomon could have never knownMatthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all thesepeople are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yetall of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tellsof his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience isdifferent, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenlyreveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.What Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official ofBabylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a differentperspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimonydares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness'stestimony, even though different from those prior, consistentlydescribes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  Now.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanaticon the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  I am.  He hasrevealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58).Please believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony fromshepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computerprogrammers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with nearcomplete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say thatthat is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audaciousdisplay of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better thanKing Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincolnr?

A speaker being a coil, it's bidirectional and makes no differencewhich way you attach.Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turboto become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I thinkthe middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wireconnects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which twowires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriatetwo wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending whichway the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard,if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on theboard, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboardis like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn'tlight, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work.If it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board.Hope this helps.Dan MoyerDan.Moyer@ColumbiaSC.NCR.COM

Circular reasoning, etc.  There have been occasionsalready stated many times for later generations of Xtians to change,edit, or otherwise alter the bible to fit their political gospel.And if we accept the bible as true just because the bible says itis true, then (to be fair) we have to do the same to the Bhagavad-Gitaand the Koran, both of which contradict the bible.Enough said./(emery)/Yet we have no reason to believe these disciples to be immoral and dishonest./We have no historic information that would lead us to the conclusion that/these people were not God-fearing people who sincerely and whole-heartedly/believed that the resurrection of their Lord Jesus was a real event./And for what gain would they lie?

Rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy andlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryptiontechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be usedby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the Clipper Chip hasbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents anew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communicationsusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today.This new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand prevent unauthorized release of data transmittedelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves theability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A key-escrow system will be established to ensure that theClipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of law-abidingAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2keys, numbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When thedevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two key-escrow data bases that will be established by theAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap.The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of Americans.To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, theAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings.The chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists.  We need the Clipper Chip and otherapproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technologytrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),the President has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          calls and data, under proper court or other legal          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the National Information          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of American industry in the global          marketplace; and      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export          high technology products.The President has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                3The Administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a National InformationInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computertechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access toinformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks(information superhighways) will transmit video, images, HDTVprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephonesystem transmits voice.Since encryption technology will play an increasingly importantrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must actquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regardingits use.  The Administration is committed to policies thatprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law.Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available.  For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute ofStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.---------------------------------QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'STELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVEQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?A:   No.  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with     no new authorities to access the content of the private     conversations of Americans.Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to     decipher the message?A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They     would then present documentation of this authorization to     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key     escrow system.Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the key-escrow data banks.Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure     how strong the security is?  A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all     potential users that there are no unrecognized     vulnerabilities.Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet     officials.Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the     decisions related to this initiative.Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?A:   The government designed and developed the key access     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip     manufacturer that produces them.Q:   Who provides the Clipper Chip?A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the future.Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating     the Clipper Chip into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more     powerful encryption devices?A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive     than others readily available today, but it is just one     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to     encryption technology, which the Administration is     developing.     The Administration is not saying, since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,     we will prohibit it outright (as some countries have     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that every     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product.  There is a     false tension created in the assessment that this issue is     an either-or proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,     balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper     Chip and similar encryption techniques.Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from     that of the Bush Administration?  A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunications and computing and are     committed to working with industry and public-interest     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime     and terrorism.Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use     the government hardware?A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.

Whilst Ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  Iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; somerelevant books are listed in a companion article.To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflectquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christianswho proselytize on alt.atheism.So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such asChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of itmay not.What is atheism?Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former isoften referred to as the weak atheist position, and the latter as strongatheism.It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  Weakatheism is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  Strongatheism is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists.Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit theiratheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than makingflat-out denials.But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.What is agnosticism then?The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of theMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed (strong) atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether God exists.Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming thatyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many peopleuse agnosticism to mean weak atheism, and use the word atheism only whenreferring to strong atheism.Beware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning, itis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say forsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn'tthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universe.So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religionsis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because theysee no evidence that God exists.But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objectsobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarlywell-defined is a matter for debate.However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provablyimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence ofGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largestprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most ofthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be toprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of Godexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may bepossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God describedby any present-day religion exists.In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently differentthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicable.But what if God is essentially non-detectable?If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interactionmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectable.If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of noimportance whether he exists or not.If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.Surely he should still be detectable today?Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that don't exist?OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is theredefinition game.  The cynical view of this game is as follows:Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points outthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  Hethen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed toit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an agreed fact, butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.The point of this digression is that the answer to the question Isn'tatheism a religious belief? depends crucially upon what is meant byreligious.  Religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith andworship.[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  religion according to such a definition. ]Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition ofreligious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well -- such asscience, politics, and watching TV.OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes in.Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are calledacts of faith, then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is certain.  This is not ageneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe exists.Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (orthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for oragainst, friend or enemy.  The truth is not so clear-cut.Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,it can be said to be anti-religion.  However, when religious believersspeak of atheists being anti-religious they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.Most atheists take a live and let live attitude.  Unless questioned, theywill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Ofcourse, this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable inmany countries.A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to convert otherswhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separationof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished.  The institution of state atheism came about whenStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the population.)Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separate.But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innature.Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  Forexample, religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their say.What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do thingsthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer inschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that theyneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public event.Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without othermotives.You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, forthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basis.Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about inconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everydaymatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to sayself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefs.To weak atheists, building a hospital to say I do not believe in God is arather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say Today is not mybirthday.  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheists.It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On theother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of others.On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independently.How do atheists differ from religious people?They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer aVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (ManyBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copyof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearance.Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of courseatheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when onetalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (right) and unacceptable(wrong) behaviour within society.Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they mustco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from anti-social or immoral behaviour, purely for the purposesof self-preservation.Many atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they carewhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.Naturally, there are some people who behave immorally and try to useatheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people whobehave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify theiractions.  For example:  Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,   be honor and glory forever and ever.The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is areligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior   deteriorated after born again experiences.  While only 4% of respondents   said they had driven intoxicated before being born again, 12% had done   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation; 5% after.                                [Freethought Today, September 1991, p. 12.]So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviour.Is there such a thing as atheist morality?If you mean Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?, then theanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.If you mean Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?, then the answeris no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theists,but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created byhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around them.Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they areunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of thatindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly make.But don't atheists want to believe in God?Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured theBig Brother figure might be.Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explainedabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.Comments such as Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properlyare likely to be viewed as patronizing.Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate isfutile.Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their livescount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.It is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in randomevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thingthat has a meaning.To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking What is themeaning of life? is as silly as asking What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee?.  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but sowhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's justhard luck.Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?The short answer is No, do you?Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism isthe sceptical default position to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheismis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,but to everyone else.What sort of harm?Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.Imagine how that effort could be better spent.Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being healed by a priest, ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- andcondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligion.Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse.What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hardto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, allconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fightand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REALChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like theCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone whocalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christiansare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely ifthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't bemuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he havemade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefsaren't a perversion of what your God intended?If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murderedothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him aChristian.Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicornsdon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, weak atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better still.Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correctit is, or whether it works; consider how many people believe in astrology,graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as well.But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it'sworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort ofconcept of God in the Christian sense.Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it'srather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one whodoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leaders.A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so far.The theory of memetics talks of memes -- sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressureto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memes.Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught it.Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just afew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions.   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to   find it.   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change   yourself.   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.and finally (and most importantly):   All beliefs should be open to question.Thanks for taking the time to read this article.mathew-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: 2.2iQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/qnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmPq0Z4hSSPpAU==q2V5-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----For information about PGP 2.2, send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.ÿ

Two different times they sent me a new card, andboth times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even triedto bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple ofdays, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeksbefore billing my card.

I agree entirely.  Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it'sworth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties ofChristianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologicallythat we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basisof sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): thethree forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis ofsex, race or sexual orientation.I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommendeveryone to read them.There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever)2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation(though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people whoindulge3) As 2, but love the sinner4) Accept homosexuality altogether.My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling thata 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, ondiscovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex,would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel thepressure not to exhibit their feelings.

The are many other possible explainations.  Could have beenthat he never existed.  There have been some good points made in this group that is not impossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths, Mithra comes to mind.->Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.

People ->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing ->someone who was or had been healed.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did ->heal people.  Logic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn'tmean that it isn't true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site.He has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die.By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is notconsistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling,so the stories got bigger to appeal better.->Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn ->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example ->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see ->this right away.->Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the ->real thing.  Or might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those whouse flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, becausein the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments amongthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excludingall other possible alternatives.However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one ofthe other two alternative is no longer valid.->Some other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in ->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal ->and Crucifixion.  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I ->write I will use it.JC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn't be any great shakes to makesure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if therewere a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet fullfilled them anyway.->I don't think most people understand what a Christian is.

Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says seriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for Xians that don't.

Excellently put!Even as a libertarian, I have to admit government does do some things Ilike.  There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft.  Lauderdalethat was partially built with tax dollars (I don't know how much wasprivate and how much was stolen, I mean public) but it is beautiful andI enjoy it.  (Keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city willnever attend a single performance there, so they might feel differentlyabout having to help pay for it.)However, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient togive government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  In fact,we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech preciselybecause it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as otherissues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on thesidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide justwhether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speechshould be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You canimagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majorityon a case-by-case basis.Not so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactlywhat they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on acase-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on acase-by-case basis.There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring withfree enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having agovernment that interferes with free enterprise in an efficientmanner; I call it political market failure.Thus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have toswallow the whole libertarian agenda.Roger Collins

Indeed, asmany other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap thatChristians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that ifyou believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarilybeing arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute,but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone. >So, I think that your position is:>The Bible is absolute truth, but as we are prone to error in our >interpretation, we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out >what that truth is.>Did I get that right?Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably*determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as falliblehuman beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The distinction is subtle yet important.When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his resultsare reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever couldhave been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken,without sacrificing his convictions.Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty.Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can knowwith complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in theright direction when he uttered, Cogito, ergo sum, yet we have not advancedmuch beyond that.Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe thatthe computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutelycertain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course,you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for allpractical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is withChristianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions aboutabsolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do) abandon these absolutes.>What's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending >absolute truth, when we can never know what those truths are, and we >can never (or at least shouldn't) act upon them?

From: kubovich@iastate.edu (Mark W Kubovich)Subject: Common-mode noise and small signalsKeywords: noise common modeOrganization: Iowa State University, Ames IALines: 20I have never worked with really small signals before and have a few questions about low level noise.  I have noticed that the waveform synthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively largecommon mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out anothertransient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred times.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends tomake my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).How can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using anHP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to 'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the input since it will read accurately down to DC.Also, if I use a differential amplifier (IA) to solve the problem, how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused by different cable capacitances)?  If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for use with transient signals with content from 1KHz to about 300KHz, I wouldappreciate it.

From: mmm@cup.portal.com (Mark Robert Thorson)Subject: Re: Barbecued foods and health riskOrganization: The Portal System (TM)Lines: 72This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today hesmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange techniqueI'd never seen before.He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similarquantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of twoteabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, withtwo chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assemblywent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprisesand concerns me are:1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do    so.WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangytaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recentlystopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weightstuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sortof larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time afterthe initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat drippingon the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and becauseit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grillnon-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like thisduck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coalsat one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on thefloor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the firein that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is thatsmoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, containsnitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actuallyhas some standing, don't know about the others.An amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal, when it wasdiscovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were puttinga lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils.This is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic.The guy who represented the company in the press conference defendedhimself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every dayfor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal-broiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that, myimmediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoalbroiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans!

Remember 'Cyprus'?>   I have to say I vehemently disagree with you, I have seenToo bad. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary,during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might andcringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publicationin Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews) when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it  becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing. Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the SanFrancisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been publishedin the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian. ...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities  against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the   murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian   neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish   and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see   the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...

From: rats@cbnewsc.cb.att.com (Morris the Cat)Subject: Vancouver/Seattle Study CritiquesOrganization: AT&TDistribution: usaLines: 360----------------------------------------------------------------------Open letter by Dr. Paul H. Blackman, Research Coordinator forNRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Dear sir:By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publicationof small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions aredrawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of momentus scientific findings. These are regularly released to the presswithout the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, andoften accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, howevermeaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittleserious studies by criminologists.The latest effort -- Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:A Tale of Two Cities, by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying editorial, Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science, by two employeesof the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insultto the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so fewdata and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some lengthto call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particularorder.1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to support the statement that some have argued that restrictingaccess to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rateof homicide. Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected thatcontention.2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are verysimilar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the citiesare very different with very different demographic characteristicswhich appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate inSeattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic whiteand *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to bethe same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the variousethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at allthe situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effectin 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighthinvolving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJMarticle there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involvinghandguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes thatone must look to see the prior situation was before concludingthat a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude thata patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each dayfor seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 withoutat least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a nationalgun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarilyselected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected becauseit was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientificreason. Would physicians call something a scientific study whichinvolved one experimental subject and one dissimilar control?Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, oppositescientific conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homiciderate *exceeds* that of such wild west cities in Texas asEl Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, ColoradoSprings. (Ref. 3)5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms orhandguns are far more commonly owned in Seattle than inVancouver. They use two surrogate approaches in pretendingto study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first isan apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carrypermits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns inVancouver. But the number clearly understates the number ofhandguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgunowners. The second, however, tells nothing about the numberof handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handgunsfor the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handgunslegally for protection, registration figures aremeaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New YorkCity (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 populationin New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouverhas a greater prevalence of weapons than New York City.The second method of measuring gun density is Cook's gunprevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercitydifferences. But the validation was by Cook of his owntheory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from adifferent doctor. More significantly, the Cook index isbased on the average of the percentage of firearms involvementin suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically takinga measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse inhomicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% inVancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle andVancouver.6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington andCanada. They neglect to mention the significant fact thatWashington has a waiting period and background check prior tothe purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadianlaw for owning and carrying handguns for personalprotection. The authors also make it appear that it is moredifficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actuallythe case.7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explainthe differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of thepenalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving afirearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the numberof law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in makingarrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrestrates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentencesimposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas socialscientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,the authors of the NEJM tale of two cities fail even to mentionmost factors related to crime control.8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effectivemeans for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is notthe case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection fromcriminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces theliklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will becompleted by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injuryto the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authorsreported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicideswithout firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattleaccounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicidesinvolving firearms.9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the study,editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it appliedscientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweebadvocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularlyhandguns. There is nothing in the paper which could possiblybe mistaken for scientific methods by a sociologists orcriminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle study is the equivolentof testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by findingtwo ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old whilegiving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressureand, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, announcing in a special article a new medical breakthrough.It would be nice to think that such a study would neither befunded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDCmake them willing to present shoddy research as scientificbreakthroughs in special articles and editorials relatingto firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifyingthe news media and those with congressional and executive oversightover the activities of the Centers for Disease Control aboutthe distortions contained in Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities and Firearm Injuries: A Callfor Science. Clearly, all scientific standards go by the waysidewhenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seizean opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.REFERENCES1.

Wright          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)      Someone once wrote: Statistics are like a bikini.  What they real is   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.  The problem is demonstrated   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and   suggested that a handgun ban may reduce the rate of homicide in a    community.      The nine medical doctors who published Handgun Regulations, Crime,   Assaults, and Homicide essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,   Why?      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,   that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and    unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.*     The second bit of evidence is Cook's gun prevalence index, which stands*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take*  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to prove it on the basis of*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.   The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of   violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the    consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin    Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are similar in   many ways, implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that all   else is equal among things being compared.*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.*  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is*  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain*  in either city.      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority    groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in gun availability   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have    anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol    abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the    Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian   percentage?      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these many ways might explain part   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide*  result in a complex picture.  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They*  also acknowledge that socio-economic status is probably an important*  confounding factor in our comparison, remarking further that blacks   *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of*  Vancouver's population.  Given the evidence presented in the article,*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,*  since detailed information about household incomes according to race*  is not available for Vancouver.      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in    gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one    would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce    crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into   account?  In this example, the hidden variable is city size: Guns are   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,   and their results are impossible to interpret.      In the editorial Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science accompanying   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the   authors for applying scientific methods to a problem of grave public   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--   is cause for further concern.

Alexander Mogilny led thecomeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shotson goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny andLaFontaine all night.Roster move:Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthyscratch.Lines:Eklund-Lindros-RecchiBeranek-Brind'Amour-DineenLomakin-Butsayev-ConroyFaust-Acton-BrownGalley-BowenYushkevich-HawgoodCarkner-McGillTommy SoderstromGame Summary:Say, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get thatwoman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS havebeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in thefirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sundaywhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them thathe was getting bored back there...Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. AfterBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boardsto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it aheadto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passedthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him andin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with hisstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to theright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric andGarry should turn down their assists :-).The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strongand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensivestruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play whenTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk intothe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and nota terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny gota post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi togive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the leaguedidn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create agood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towardsthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody keptmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to givethe Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and thefans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shotswere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay wasdisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considereda rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way theseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it wasRuss Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and EdSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd doit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled fornext year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at theend of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.He expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division titlethe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This basedon the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.He's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it outstanding). Happy withthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unfluxof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that therewas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen infour years if there was a consensus.The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad Maytook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little troublegetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was movingthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabresblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passedacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and thetop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck tricklingthrough the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won therace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.Then Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue lineand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom wasall over it.The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking whenBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefertook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln'tget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into theFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it andheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead tomake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the topof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, JohnMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.But the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time tojust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were allover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got throughSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone thatmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander ashe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.Mistake

The following letter, which represents a small portion of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and prosperously.------------------------- letter ----------------------------------During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocidein order to shift international public opinion away from its politicalresponsibility.2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide.3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism throughthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-SovietArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence throughterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supportersof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community frommaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorialdemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish peoplewill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victimsof the Turkish Genocide demand:1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish andKurdish people;3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officiallyrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuseto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in theefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politicallymature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, throughall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call uponall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversaryof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

I should do as much research as possible, go back and review the scene, transcribe what happened to tape or paper, use any witnesses that may have been around, have a list of questions to ask the cop and/or the judge,and to be positive and assertive.  I am innocent until proven guilty! <gulp>A few people suggested trying to get my court date changed, as this might trip up the arresting officer, he may not show up if the date is on his dayoff or if he feels/knows that he doesn't have a chance to win against you.One individual stated that an Officer could be an Expert Witness, and if hesays I was speeding, then by damn, I was speeding.Another says that I must have been paced or clocked with a radar gun.Lots of good suggestions and ideas from you all.

This is a PhD research project and I have to testthe chip at speed on a PCB. I expect to have roughly 100packaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speedtesting using 3 different set-ups for the test chip. I know for sure that a DIP will not work(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).Getting a custom-made package is too expensive, soI am trying to choose between a flatpak and aleadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hardto test since it has to be soldered on to the testsetup and I would spend loads of time soldering as I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chipcarrier sockets also have long lead lines and maynot work at high speeds. Does anyone out there have experience/knowledgeof this field ? I would greatly appreciate help! Any ideas/names of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packageswould help.  P.S. The multi-layer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bitof overkill(?) --- Seema Varma

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions.However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faintones to be consistent with being equally dense for as faras we can see--it is as if they are all contained withina finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at thecenter.  (These measurements are statistical, and you canalways hide a sufficiently small number of a differenttype of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assumingthat there is only one population of GRBs).The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the centerof the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact centerof are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of cometsway beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placingGRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies tobe released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud modelstend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy)you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane ofthe Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center(for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if theyare Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years inradius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the AndromedaGalaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, theEarth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.>my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering>hyperspace :-)The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don'tsee many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.>but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they>are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered>if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature.Right now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratoriumon new models until new observational evidence comes in.-- David M.

Of course, we cannot really sayhow the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion,but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it.So basically, we can not judge whether religion is the right route fora given individual, or even for a general population.

They did some fine penely-killing in the first (2 men downfor a couple of minutes at one point) but they just couldn't keep it up.  They spent virtually the entire game either short-handed orjust coming off a penelty -- as soon as they'd get re-grouped, they'repenalized again! Sheesh -- like Gilmour said after the 1st -- you can't go calling every little push an shove in a game like that.  And if you're goingto, you have to do it for both teams. Pearson (one of my four favorite Leafs) played like a bonehead -- Isaw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities, andthen he got that *bonehead* 5-minute major high-sticking penalty. Cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand-full ofgames ago and he played a good game.  If the other players on his linecan smarten up, that line should do okay.  Clark's got to get tough --he's got to intimidate and go for the net.  Send Clark up the left wing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot willput some numbers on the board... and Pearson... heck, maybe he shouldbe benched. I hate to repeat Grapes, but where the heck was Foligno?  Zezel can'tdo all the checking himself -- and get MacLlwain on the move... we need some speed out there!  Keep Potvin in net, he did okay considering... although (like I said a couple weeks ago) Potvin messed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year -- he can easily do it again. My prediction last week was Toronto in 7 -- that the games DET wins will be blow-outs and the game TOR wins will be close -- I still standby that. Don't fret, Leafs fans, in order to win in 7, the other team has towin 3! :-) Burns is going to make some magic -- he'll mix up some lines.  Matchthe Wings line-per-line.  He'll have his team checking hard, and he'llnever let them get out-numbered in their own end.  The Leafs will winWednesday night... and will take 1 or their home games (probably thefirst one).

This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the  belief that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist. This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can't see them)  The  reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.>Fine, but why do these people shoot themselves in the foot and mock the idea of>a God?

There is a big difference here, Stalin didn't say that he stood for a   particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and  then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least  an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the  russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict  your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant  to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists  can't value life as much as theists (which you didn't support).  >Agnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable.  Yet>they do in some sense seem funny because they believe that the existence of God>is unknowable.  This in itself is every bit the assumption that atheism is,>though it's less arrogant and pompous. Ah, and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ.  An atheist doesn't have to hold the positive view that god doesn't exist, he/she may just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here's the example:  Strong atheism - I believe god does not exist   a positive belief Weak atheism   - I don't believe in a god       a negative belief  these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that you are calling unreasonable.  Or let's look at it this way (in sets)  suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:  christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god  atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)  atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set  agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E', ....) >Why are people so afraid to say undecided?

If you do sincerely believe that a god exists, why do you follow>it blindly?  >     Do the words Question Authority mean anything to you?>     I defy any theist to reply.      Dear Defiant (or Unfaithful or Pixie):I will take up the challenge to reply, as I am a theist.The foundation for faith in God is reason, without which the existenceof God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reasonis indisputable (cf. my short treatise, Traditional Proofs for the Existence of God, and Summa Theologica).Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason,I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallencondition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter,the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, theMeasure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives orderto the universe (logos).I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which iscontrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And,since God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savioras early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that becausea human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Sourceof all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship.Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claimis true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the UnitedStates Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellentinstructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I willreply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned,and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  Forexample, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he couldhave denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics mustbe obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true. Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.QED -- boundaryno teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no hevenido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, Vulgata Latina)

The second question is something that's beenknown for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quittingsmoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of theperson who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in theinterim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack perday for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Stillrather low overall, but significant.

Center for Regional StudiesLines: 366From: _Quantum_ Magazine, March/April 1993 pages 42-46The Problem Book of Anania of Shirak------------------------------------On the ancient peak of AraratThe centuries have come like secondsAnd passed on.-Avetik Issahakianby Yuri DanilovSome years ago Journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them: Whatbooks would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight? And though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30, depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer, and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes, ages, and professions, not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them atleast one book of arithmetic problems.Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for numbers (though secretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were no exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: I willingly confess that any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it wasa hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of my friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade teachers.Now, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the bookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, toVenus and back.One for the roadThey both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley glanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. God knows what this kind of stuff leads to, thought Kingsley.The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History of Herodotus. Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides, thought the Royal Astronomer.--Fred Hoyle, The Black CloudThe book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 elegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the sametime, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian architecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is now Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant letters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of Komitas, or the paintings of Saryan.An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a bibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutionsof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh Century (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).The abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let justanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk Father Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable problem book.Vardapet Anania of ShirakOnce fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering it the mother of all wisdom.--Anania of ShirakAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his work. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems andSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimationof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, andArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the lastwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, Movses of Khoren).In his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:I, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of ourArmenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, in the expression of the psalmist, every day I illuminated the eyes of my mind. Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, the mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the sciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told methat in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,Christosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But         soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but         only of certain fragmentary facts.I then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the coast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature. I asked them how they knew this. They answered: We saw ourselves that many people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,Philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become pupils of Tyukhik. When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to God, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I had come. He received me graciously and said: I praise Our Lord that He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. Gregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself lived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there. Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with me. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated the science of number, and with such success that my fellow studentsat the king's court began to envy me.I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not been translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why enumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did not have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translatingthat when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into Armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the translation read as if the work were written in that language originally.Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had learned the Armenian language. When I was young, he said, I lived in Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and for a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and literature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was wounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to the Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: If You prolong my life, I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to collecting treasures of knowledge. And the Lord heard my prayers. After I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria and Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher from Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.After some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for him, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to assume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to God not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But becauseof his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study with him.And I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's help, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me for my efforts.Problems and SolutionsA half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printedon verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and forty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many copies were printed in all.--Imitation of Anania of ShirakA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (books have their own fate).The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. Themanuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to Armenian historians, in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded from invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children. Bidingtheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of ancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).And its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two manuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction and commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, annotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).In the translator's words, the problems of Anania are amusing, full of life, and simple. Orbeli goes on to say: The subjects of the problems are generally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland Shirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are named, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a contemporary of Anania. Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used only aliquots -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it isnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).Like any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the retelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their full glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.Problems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. 572.Problem 1My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.Problem 8During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when ZaurakKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to thePersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a day. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in a day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.Problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian translation, they are all called dishes. But in the original Armenian, according to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are called mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian word, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before Anania's Problems and Solutions.Problem 18There was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the metal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; fromone fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten drams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in Anania's time -- for instance, problem 7.Problem 7Once I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank of the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. We caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slippedout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found forty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.The temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myselfand offer you just one more.Problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that inhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is nomention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according to the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of Shirak offers evidence to the contrary .Problem 20The hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, was at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wilddonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, running to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived withhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild beasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by arrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were caught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And so, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.Set in type by me, Iosef OrbeliHis biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a bibliography.-- K Uzbashyan, AcademicianIosef Abgarovich OrbeliAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the solution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation of Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,has probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, and the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for a degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An advertisement at the end of the book reads: This book was typeset in December 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by me, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with borders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project to the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.Typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned orientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis Academiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian churches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve the unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.Strolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the blockade of Leningrad in World War II.)When Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times were hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Ananiawas for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the printer's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the Academy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless championof Russian academic typography.Back to EarthThis book by definition does not exhaust all the most important works in this domain. The editor hopes that those who are guilty of this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame, will work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph.--V. Bonch-Bruyevich introduction to theRussian translation of Solid-BodySymmetry by R. Knox and A. GoldLet's imagine a time when space flight is an everyday thing, and high schoolers will spend their breaks as astronauts-in training in the Perelman crater on the far side of the Moon. Maybe one of the space travelers will take this very copy of Quantum, and another, looking over her shoulder, will read this article and say to himself: This Anania from Shirak seems like a pretty interesting guy. When I get home I'll try to find his problems.Good luck, my young friend! Anania is sure to entertain you. Perhaps by thenthere will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions. And we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by Iosef Orbeli.[1] Vardapet (or vartabed) means teacher or learned man in Armenian. (The    Armenian language suffers in English from a dual transliteration scheme.    Thus, Mesrop is often rendered as Mesrob, Komitas as Gomidas, and so     on).[2] Fourth Armenia was one of fifteen provinces into which, according to    Armenian Geography in the Seventh Century A.D., so-called Great Armenia    was divided.[3] Pontus (or Pontus Euxinus) was an old name for the Black Sea.[4] Azats were members one of several strata of freemen in ancient Armenia.[5] Ter was the title of the heads of sovereign royal families in ancient      Armenia.-- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | How do we explain Turkish troops onS.D.P.A.

What I have seen from the March Beta isthat it doesn't yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-userfeatures. I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn't allowtwo users share one GUI. My interpretation of this was that one userper console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want. I believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from thirdparty. Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on thenet. There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell likecsh on Unix for remote logins. In general I liked NT when I checked it out. It slow compared toWin3.1 (just like any other real OS). The beta version, although beingslow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation. Windows subsystemsalso start up a lot faster than X windows. I believe Bill Gates wasright when he stated that NT was not for everybody. After playingaround with it for a while I was convinced. If I owned a busines usinga business computer from IBM or some other established vendor, Iwould consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a muchcheaper solution (If you are running SQL servers etc.). It providesthe robustness such an application requires. On the other hand if you like your DOS games, more or less forgetabout NT. You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeatsthe purpose of using NT. Most of NT's features are visible in anetworked environment and in such an environment you can't reboot yourmachine at will. For personal use, I would rather wait for the Win32based Windows release (whatever you name it) than jump to NT bandwagon.I expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32becomes widely available. --Sadun Anik, U of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignCenter for Reliable and High-performance Computinge-mail: anik@crhc.uiuc.edu

I've always hated phase-control for the RFI, buzzingfilaments and non-linear adjustment range. I hadheard that you can modulate the AC line on a cycle bycycle basis to get better results. To cut the lamp'spower to 50% you would givemsay 20 cycles of AC, thennothing for another 20 cycles. I wonder if anyone hastried this or knows what the pro stuff is using.

One reply, whichI have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last week's_America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles Bourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT translation in the New American Bible.  He noted ...certain practices have been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality, and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy.  I note that at my parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word risen.  This was not a kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass.I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as awhole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversationon topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself).Sometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that isthe exception, I think.

Everybody's got anopinion and is dead certain they are right.  Yet acurate information isextremely difficult to come by.  The DMV doesn't know.  Cops don'tknow.  Your traffic school instructor doesn't know.  The vehicle codeonly tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in awide variety of ways.  And the public at large?  I seldom hear anyadvice that doesn't disagree with something I've experienced.If you don't believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code,study it, and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what reallyhappens.  Read Fight Your Ticket too, but don't miss the littlesection at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you'rebasically screwed.As you may have guessed, I'm pretty down on the system here inCalifornia.  I've carefully prepared for court, bringing witnesses andrevealing serious holes in the officer's story, only to be slapped withthe maximum allowable fine (plus assessments of over 100%) - themessage clear that the judge does not appreciate John Q Public tryinghis own cases.So here's my advice when you find yourself with a ticket:  Take trafficschool if you can.

Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, andlater, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, thenumber of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibilitywith their hardware increases, as does the questions on theavailability of drivers for their hardware, installationprocedures, etc.Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports WindowsMultimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM isincluding direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, orfor free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- readcomp.os.os2.misc for details).Proposed Charters:(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)It will provide a forum for developers of ported software soas to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, andspur additional development.  The group will also covertopics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in programportability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), andso forth.(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchyorthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed tocomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroupfor OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues andtechnical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including theavailability of device drivers, compatibility information,installation procedures, system requirements, and overallperformance optimization.(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bugdiagnosis and work arounds, the availability of systempatches and corrective service disks, and so forth.[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in othernewsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong incomp.os.os2.beta]How to Vote:To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to thispost.

The general setup is designed so that when users connect they send a private key encrypted using the system publickey and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap theone-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  Theresult of this is that even if I reveal the system private key itis impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on themachine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealedsystem private key to entice users into revealing thier personalprivate keys during the authentication sequence.Questions:Does the fact that the system private key does not provide anyinformation useful for a search give me any protection as far asbeing coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I amassisting in entrapment (the users would send thier key anywayand are not being enticed into doing something they would nototherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...jim-- Jim McCoy                |  UT Unix Sysadmin Tiger Teammccoy@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu |

From: mcelwre@cnsvax.uwec.eduSubject: NATURAL ANTI-cancer/AIDS RemediesOrganization: University of Wisconsin Eau ClaireLines: 224     The biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so EXTREMELY high andincreasing is that NATURAL methods of treatment and even diagnosis are stillbeing SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED and SUPPRESSED by the MONEY-GRUBBING and POWER-MONGERING medical establishment.     Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed inthe following article:                          NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES                                 A 3RD OPINION                         ( Some of these Remedies also work against AIDS. )          DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources           that have shown themselves to be reliable.  The compiler of           this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his           First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the           subjects of his choice.           ( MOST of these Remedies can be found in ANY Grocery Store.            MOST of the rest of them can be found in ANY Health Food           Store.  What is important is HOW they are used, and what           else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )          (1) THE 7-DAY FAST.                1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind           at a time, preferably grapes.                2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half           raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape           clean the intestinal linings.                3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice           you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune           juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from           concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to           your home bathroom.)                4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and           dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS           CONTAIN LAETRILE.).                5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from           two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and           add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).            Drink one glass per hour.          [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day           every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH           PULP.]                6th day: Same as 5th day.                7th day: Same as 6th day.                All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each           day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements,           plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.           (2) THE GRAPE DIET.                Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to           8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the           six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.                 (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.               Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple           cider flavored vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a           glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.            Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a           week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal           healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially           effective against those types of cancer that resemble a           FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.                   (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]               Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level           comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.            Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely           dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt           (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.                Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising           your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your           stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down,           chomping your teeth together, etc..                Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes           the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the           book Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2, by Frances Nixon, 1973.                PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should           prepare it and drain it.          For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away           from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly           expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt           other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at           least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.            (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take           a 2-Billion-bacteria Acidophilus capsule, which is also an           EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF A.I.D.S.           (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the           digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune           system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal           bacteria, it may also be a CURE for Lyme disease.]          Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder           storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during Major or           Minor Periods as listed in the Solunar Tables published           bimonthly in Field & Stream Magazine, (because of the           measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields           present at those times).          Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year.                  (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES:                       For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the                affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons                per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for                about 2 months.                        D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to                perform NORMAL cell functions.                ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.                 To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.                 To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per                day.               [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.                 IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer                cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile                into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is                ALSO present in the digestive system.)]                ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include                Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most                people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A                (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide                Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up                to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-               toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime                will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types),                suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes,                prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not                cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST                A.I.D.S., which is really a form of cancer similar to                leukemia.]  (See the book Life Extension, by Durk                Pearson and Sandy Shaw.)                HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3%                hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably                DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day,                hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.                 Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers                several times per day.               Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good                daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants                described above.                VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and                much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA                doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources.                Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell)                NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on                and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an                aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-               radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with                daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH                magnetic fields.                Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES                can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well                as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics                Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos                of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays!                INTERFERON tablets.               TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho).                           HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical                problems (even drug addiction!).                50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure                prostate trouble.                This list is NOT exhaustive.           The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-          DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent           and cure many other medical problems including heart-          diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work           effectively.           Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these           remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send           a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it           to CURE the cancer.           In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer,           then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies           described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast),           BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations           and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer           treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].

The compiler of           this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his           First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the           subjects of his choice.

Openingstatements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,each side presenting its version of what happenned last August.The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved toIdaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the evil federalgovernment.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federalagents sawed off shotguns and later failed to appear fortrial: Despite repeated good faith efforts to get Weaverto surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout eruptedwhen Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission andbegan firing.  According to the prosecution, three peoplewere taking an offensive action against an FBI helicopterwhen an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northernIdaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wantedsimply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents tosell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecutionalleged, want to become a regular supplier).  The defense alsoargued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver whenhe wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatistangle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  Thefailure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was givenan incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killedWeaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaverthen fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federalagent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:However, agents were near the body for an extended period oftime and could have played with the select-fire - this willhave to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claimsthat Vicki Weaver was only going to look at the body [not recover?]of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.Prosecution quote: Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he madethat confrontation. -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim LindquistDefense quote: The evidence in this case is going to show thatthis is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are chargedwith crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes thatthe government did commit.  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]Notes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supportersheeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protestsoutside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliateagain had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters includingTim again.  Tim claimed he was a skinhead, who were ordinary,working class people.  He also claimed he was for white pride,not white power.Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interviewwith Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactlywhat the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, abouta dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into thecourthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spencein action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Sometidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kentwere volunteering their time to represent Weaver because theybelieved in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on thedefendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during therecounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the sawedoff shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (anothergood one!).Today (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled tobegin presenting evidence.Drew=============================================================-- *************************************************************** Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com ** Senior Customer Engineer                                   ** Intergraph Electronics                                     ** 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 ** Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 ***************************************************************

No one can browbeat youinto believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in drivingyou further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attainit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain thissalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certainmodern offshoots like the new age movement teach or does he require God'shelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can suchhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and forsome people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in aposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few,of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).The spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read A Pilgrim'sProgress, I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).>Peace and Love>In God(ess)'s name>James MossNow I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be aconflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  Youwrote that I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not mostof the teachings of christ.  Well, Christ referred to God as My Father,not My Mother, and while the maleness of God is not the same as themaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does nothonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intentto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, Godchose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the humanpopulation.Well, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion ofthe role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in thelast 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in thisarticle.

Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestictransport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods werecrucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plentyof good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidlyexpanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of thefirst auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two goodbooks on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco America on theRoad (title may not be exact - author is) and another called The DevilWagon in God's Country author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  orJohn Bell Rae's auto histories.As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the earlyteens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheelon the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on theright, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tillerinstead of a wheel.

Theyinclude the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli, thefact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and thehistorical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem.When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948,the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visitreligious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan,who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  TheJordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned aJewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in theirlatrines.Israel has allowed individuals of all religions intoJerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness tocontrol the city.Also, I should point out that Islam is not centered inJerusalem, but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca,where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).

In actuality it is chorion, which is the last word Acts> 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss chorion so I> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do fromothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I donot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence inthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of researchspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is notas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still amnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turnsout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich Greek Lexicon renderseach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabeticalorder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax isfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makesthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 isindeed chorion. Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament, Louw and NidaRobinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New TestamentGreek English Lexicon of the New Testament, GrimmWord study Concordance, TynsdaleA Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other  early Christian Writings, Bauer-Arndt-GingrichThe New Analytical Greek Lexicon, PerschbacherIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:A space, place, region, district, field, area, country place, land, farm, estate, a bit of tillage, and similar meanings.Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about grave. As some of these books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into contradictions to be once again, as your friend said it, lacking in substance, and thus Archer is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found themto support Mr Archer's contentions). By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition ofagros, the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The wordagros is defined as a field in the country. Chorion is specifically notedas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how sillyBullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for field in Matthew(ie: agros) is different from the word for field in Acts (ie: chorion), andthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you alreadyadmit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipitywhich drives the point home). So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answerquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet indiscussing the Potter's Field.

Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year,   many of them are commercial businesses. The ban on commercial   use of Internet is no more.Jack, there is a difference between using the network for commercialpurposes and advertising in newsgroups.  Business communication isokay.  Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planetwho have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.   Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only   by our innate good taste and no have no administrator to    guide(?) us.I suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material notin anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attentionit didn't want.  You may belong to the public library, but thatdoesn't mean you can deface the books, disorder the stacks, or disturbthe other patrons.You're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (manyacademic and military, who get irritable about a network for whichthey pay with tax and grant money carrying private businessadvertising) follow.  There are Secret Masters here, just likeeverywhere else.  They're not as obvious as the ones on Prodigy, butthey're here.No doubt at some point the Internet, like everything else, will becomegrotty enough to carry advertising.

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.What could be better, declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubsare challenging?     It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked, announcedRyne Sandberg.  If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, orBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able towin.     Lord, I hope we pull it off.     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, PeteRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cutthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threwto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose tothird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let himbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks thisyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into agap in right-center.  Cool Papa Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball offand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boonegrounded out to second, ending the threat.       Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt orTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure onKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spellsRose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able tosustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.  So came theanalysis from Frank Chance.     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' groundermoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singledhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Kleinsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen poppedout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hittingfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded intoa 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring astrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quickTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced apop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  TheCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To getanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlockplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpenwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead againstLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, drivinghome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler addedanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpenhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 moreruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at onepoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, offRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, butthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  BruceSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in theeighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and wouldconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.-------------------------------------------------------------------     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among theall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their firstfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out offirst in this wacky season.     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled SteveRogers 3-2.  We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of ourteam speed, remarked Lou Brock.  I don't see why we can't win thisdivision.     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds ofthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.-------------------------------------------------------------------     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,now 2 back - but in 4th!    When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in apitcher's park like this, spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  KeithHernandez added that their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.  The Pirates have made only26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tendto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshoneSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  WhenNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, thePirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  BertBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessedfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on homeruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by RalphKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in thetop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after MookieWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner onfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with KentTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds inleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcingStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing thePirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulveallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the rightfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who enteredto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deepcenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-parkhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.------------------------------------------------------------------     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):     Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giantsmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some startingpitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this comingweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette andthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschelfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homerhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and DonBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott hadone each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday'sdoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of theNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win afterretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, butfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in thefirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as theBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.The homer by Aaron was a magical

EDT               SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.          You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational system.          His philosophy of government, his belief in the importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in the Chamber of Commerce studios.            Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite network and we welcome you here this evening.          Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening also.          I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.          I believe the President has a few words that he might want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that at this time.  It's great to have you.          THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.          I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people from school to the work place.          I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to make things happen.          This satellite town meeting is a good example of that kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all the rest of you.          I have tried as hard as I could to move toward constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.            If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change with changing times.          For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the long run.          We also have to have people who can carry their load.  And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system and continues into the work force where education must go on for a lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can learn.          And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many thousands that have a strong education component so our young people can be learning and working at the same time.          Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good place we can begin, I think, the discussion.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.          Each month we get together and talk about ways that all citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours can prepare students for this world of work.          This week, the Education Department and the Labor Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged areas of the country.            Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your words is that so important?          THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already taught before.          Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is learning because we think that the best and most productive workers will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go into the next year, is really even greater.            Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this educational component of training.          SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or working on something, and they can see the exact and direct application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of young people even beyond the summer.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.            Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it developing.          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people get in a high school diploma.            If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their employers.          So we think America has a big economic interest in trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes two years of further training either in a community college, a vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in a way that would be customized essentially by the business community, based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and the earnings of American workers.          SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the people watching this program -- that the business community and educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The people watching this program probably are the ones who are most directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes already out there.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?          SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.          The business community is going to be actively engaged in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.          Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these players in a community come together and work together and cooperate together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody is talking, but they're not really working together in a common strategy.          And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation skills for on-the-job learning.          And again, those are the critical components.  It's already being done.          THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one point based on my personal experience at home -- the business community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and influence them.  So I think that's very important.          And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.          SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be coming forth before too long.          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.            I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in Congress that will actually define the things that the national government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of life-long learning in this country.          And each one of those goals there's a national role, a state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality that we need to meet.          It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.          Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and I wonder if you would comment on that.          SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had national skill standards to which they could aspire and which employers would understand as a national credential, many of these young people would actually find that they were much more eligible for jobs.          Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce Todd of Austin, Texas.          Q  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are very supportive.            We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much as 3,500 with the federal assistance.            Much of the question that we had designed you have answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's something that we believe is very important to success in this effort.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.          THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.            First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer program and that will move a lot of these young people back into schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're working on that.          Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being trained on a year-round basis.          And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.          Bob, do you want to say anything?          SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And then the state, with all the various school districts, a very important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that moving.          The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.            Doctor?          Q  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an extremely effective learning strategy.          And over the years, we've come to believe that there are several principles that are very important in bridging the school and work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the development of high performance competencies.            My question, then is:  How can the general education faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies can you suggest to achieve this integration?          SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to them and we can discuss it later.          You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?          THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is vocational learning and what is academic learning.          I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think we should have a strong component for people who are in the vocational program.          SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're important for all students.  It's not just a special group of students that needs them.          Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and 12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and career directions.          But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-related work within the classroom, within our schools.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.                                   END9:00 P.M. EDT

Again, many Jewish families escaping from Nazi Armenians and Hitler's Nazi Germany took refugee in Turkiye during the 1940's.

And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in 'fanatic' Turkey when they were expelled from Europe, especially Spain, by Saintly Christians, and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers. To one brought up, as most Americans have  been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of  the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every  nation in the world would have treated as treasonable. One readily  reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate... He also stated that:they [Armenians] traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian  invader; that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war, and that they burned at least a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population.                TURKEY AND THE HOLOCAUSTAn  interview  with  Stanford  J. Shaw  (History),  who  recentlycompleted  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  theTurkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role inRescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution,1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degreeprogram in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program forthe Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with theG. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.Editor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey andEuropean and Turkish Jews?Shaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish.I've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and astime went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,I collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until acouple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  andcoming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  WilshireAvenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on OttomanJewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  becamemotivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, TheJews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This bookis quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, whotend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpointof the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewishsources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  Iapproach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point ofview of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After Ifinished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  acrossadditional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World WarII. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a gooddeal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  notactually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents inthe Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkishdiplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. Itwas too late to add this new information to the book in press, soI decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and theTurkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the secondbook, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helpedrescue Jews from the Nazis.- How exactly did they do this?The story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presentsthe material in three parts, first of which deals with the periodbefore the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-NaziGermans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, andthe like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process ofreforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who werebeing fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of newtalent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within threemonths  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkeyarranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey andwere   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkishuniversities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medicalpersonnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professorscame to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German politicalscientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  inTurkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during theBerlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economicsin Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from theNazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventuallycame to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. OtherGerman Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.One  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatricalproducer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went toTurkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and theTurkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of PaulHindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this firstphase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued byTurkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  inTurkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regardedthemselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join inthe anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. Ieven  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkeypraising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promotingthe idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had beenpersecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared theNazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. Thesecond part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, andespecially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. Theyhad migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn ofthe century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during theTurkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece wasthreatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jewsthroughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what mighthappen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fledto France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned theirTurkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  theNazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts ofanti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was notworth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lotto be a Turkish Jew.- How so?Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retainedits embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countriesuntil it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at theend of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a positionto  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  theactions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter ofthe  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  inparticular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship fromthe Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkishcitizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  werearrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomatswould  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  otherofficials and say in effect:  These people are Turkish citizens.You  can't do  this  to  them. And  the  Turkish  Jews would  bereleased.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkishdiplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasionof the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium andmanganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, theyusually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration campsto secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boardedtrains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination andsucceeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jewswere sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy inParis,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkishconsuls took place.The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandonedtheir  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. Theconsuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizensbecause  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jewslining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  getpassports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of theirTurkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  soprocessing the application would take  some time. In the meantimeit was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews onthe streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest themif they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, becauseradios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care ofthese  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  adocument called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  irregular fellowcitizen. The  document said in  effect This person is  a formerTurkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  hisTurkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it ifyou  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.  Thediplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals onit. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole theyaccepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By thismeans, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews whohad relinquished their Turkish citizenship.Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense ofJews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted toretain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting theseinterventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted allJews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able toprevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitzbefore the Turkish consuls could do anything.- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?There were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world WarII,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  theinformation in this section of  the book relates to the situationin France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consulssent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back inreply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul wouldpresent  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  areTurkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, theNazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkishconsuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews fromNazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ranregularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visasso they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains wereoften  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  EasternEurope  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  thesegovernments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result ofthe Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the TurkishJews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  toAuschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 eitherescaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  ofsouthern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews muchbetter than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italyfell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.Incidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece alsoworked to rescue Jews in that country.- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomatsacting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish originfrom Nazi persecution.Yes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  theirinterventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited theirtreaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in Germanterritory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.On  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  notdiscriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazisclaimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  notdiscriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.Turkey  protested,   saying,  You  are  dividing   our  citizensaccording to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires thatall  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.Therefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews. American consulsin  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  toldAmerican Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that theycouldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews werebeing treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the booktakes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during theHolocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern EuropeanJews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews inPalestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office inIstanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  OtherJewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, alsosent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. Thesegroups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find outwhat was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but atthat  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn'timagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so thefirst step was to get information, and the Turkish government letthem use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives andfriends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found outwhat was happening when they  received replies. Later on when theNazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  receivedassistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  whoserved as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vaticanrepresentative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  theCatholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government wasdoing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in EasternEurope.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, theseagencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  evenrailroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much inPoland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all thePolish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged forthe Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through theso called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat throughthe Black Sea to Istanbul.Turkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within itsborders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and wassuffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   Thegovernment,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   thenon-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either bythe Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria andPalestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterraneanfrom southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterlyopposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who didnot want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because theyfeared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The Britishconstantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this trafficand send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,yielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  Forexample, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700Jewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkishgovernment  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  Britishambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, allwere lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkishgovernment allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews topass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine duringthe Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided theserefugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission tosend money and food out of the country.- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  beliving in Israel.Yes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to thefirst group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did notgo  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  thenon-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey enroute to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.- And you have rescued it from obscurity.Many studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them donot focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most ofthe scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, ofwhom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with amuch smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out thepicture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  toundertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.When it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relativelysmall in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. Therescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  sosignificant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  weremurdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.About  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -translations  of many  documents. They  are included  because thestory is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unawareof  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  thepeople of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they wouldnot  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  theycould see the documents.- What languages are used in the documents?Most of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. Thereis a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization ofthe boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but Idid not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly whatTurkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. Afew documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul didnot necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; infact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns tryingto  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  Forexample, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agencywas  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only inhelping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  PresidentRoosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who hadbeen an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New YorkCity, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. Thedocuments related to his mission are in English.I also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocausthistorian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (Hisfather was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he hadgathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn'tpersonally consult the German archives.  I believe that much morecan  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someonesomeday will make the effort.- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?Right. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of theOttoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  Inaddition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been activelyinvolved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of thecoming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, Ihelped organize  a large international conference  on the subjectwhich was held in Istanbul in 1992.- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has takenplace, what do you plan to do next?I'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish Warfor Independence, which took place  after World War I, during theyears  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  thevictorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  itsindependence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul HamidII, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was animportant modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressedall sorts of political movements.Stanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  inBritish History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earninga second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidateat Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the Schoolof  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  theUniversity of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and theUniversity of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming toUCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by theJohn Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institutein  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  NationalEndowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. Hehas  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  andBosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honorfor lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkishstudies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, andCulture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey inWashington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professionalservice activities and public lectures  in both the United Statesand Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one editedvolume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2vols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  orreprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983,1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empireand  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  YorkUniversity Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translationby the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and theHolocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewryfrom Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by MacmillanPublishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.  Apamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara, Turkey, in1992.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

You are asking me to provide objective proof for the existence ofGod.  I never claimed to be able to do this; in fact I do not believethat it is possible to do so.  I consider the existence of God tobe a premise or assumption that underlies my philosophy of life.It comes down to a matter of faith.   If I weren't a Christian, Iwould be an agnostic, but I have sufficient subjective evidence tojustify and sustain my relationship with God.  Again this is a matterof premises and assumptions.  I assume that there is more to life, theuniverse and everything than materialism; ie that spirituality exists.This assumption answers the question about why I have apparent spiritualneeds.  I find this assumption consistent with my subsequent observat-ions.  I then find that God fills these spiritual needs.  But I cannot objectively prove the difference between apparent filling of imagined spiritual needs and real filling of real spiritual needs.  Nor can Iprove to another person that _they_ have spiritual needs.==Seanna Watson   Bell-Northern Research,       | Pray that at the end of living,(seanna@bnr.ca) Ottawa, Ontario, Canada       | Of philosophies and creeds,                                              | God will find his people busyOpinion, what opinions?

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has 36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captainthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos andMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category thanMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player onthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guessI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last seasonas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all comingfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: AndrewCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, andPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed therole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yakebounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will putup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, startedperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to theright side.Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen startedthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commandedthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked hisway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years leftto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subparafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes ofcompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much betterhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who onlyseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he gotto make a number of starts in a row.-SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder)-steveg@cadkey.com

From: welty@cabot.balltown.cma.COM (richard welty)Subject: rec.autos: Automotive Mailing Lists: how to set up your ownKeywords: Monthly PostingReply-To: welty@balltown.cma.comOrganization: New York State Institute for Sebastian Cabot StudiesLines: 116Archive-Name: rec-autos/part6[New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw]Many people want to set up mailing lists for their favoriteautomotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it.  This articlewill provide the essential information for doing so on standardUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setupsare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.comfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotivemailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I canlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of theUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is alsoimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seemslike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that youhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity isprobably not good enough.Listserv:There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, whichis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details ofthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of thisarticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list shouldprobably  look at listserv carefully.The Alias file:On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases onwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:foo:   bar, baz, bletchwhich means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host isredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplestpossible email list is my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-addressmy-favorite-car-request: my-addressthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being thatyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you cando the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-listmy-favorite-car-request: my-addressWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separatedaddresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory,owned by the list admin.Bounced Mail:this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all themembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set upis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,by the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)school-request:   weltyschool-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/listschool: |/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript schoolowner-school: school-requestowner-school-out: school-requesthere's what is going on here:the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mailcoming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the pointof contact for administrative duties.school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses,it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resendingthe email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name;the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at theactual list members.the shell script i use is as follows:-----------------

The United States, withits people, have recognized that repression has taken place, with theloss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutionalprotections of citizens. This recognition has taken the form of thecivil rights law (let's just discuss the federal level for now), suchas 18 USC 241 et. seq., 42 USC 1981 et. seq, et. al.   With this recognition of repression, at times manifested in theform of collective guilt, I want people to recognize denial. Though it can be said that white people numerically commit morecrimes in the United States, because white people are a majority,it can also be said that black people commit a disproportionateamount of crime in the United States, in their relation to theirnumbers in population.   My views are out of experiences when I was a police officerin a large metropolitan area, and of a citizen.

If they aren't Atheists,>what are they?When the Quran uses the word *din* it means way of individual thinking, behaving,communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs. This is ofteninterpreted as the much weaker term religion. The atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews,Mushriqin, Christians, etc. because the  latter are all din. To have adin you need a set of beliefs, assumptions, etc, to forma a socialcode. For example the Marxist have those, such as History, Conflict,etc. That they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to representthose assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the otherMushriq, or roughly polytheists. There cannot be social Atheism, because when there is a community,that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate the society. When they inscribe assumptions, say Nation, or Progress is the natural consequence of Human activity or parlamentariandemocracy is doubtlessly the best way of government, however they individually insist they do not have gods, from the Quranic pointof view they do. Therefore by definition, atheism does not exist. We are a atheist society in fact means we reject the din other thanours. Atheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/suppositions/.. of the society that they part, and in that case thatis a personal deviation of belief, and Quran tells about suchdeviations and disbelief. But as I mentioned, from a Quranic point oflooking at things, there is no Atheism in the macro level. I think it took more than one minute.Kutluk

A problem with TT fonts in Windowsis that they do get converted to T1 format OK, and the hinting is even usedwhile this is done, but the resulting T1 fonts are NOT hinted.  The resultis that they WILL work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by theprinter driver when the PS file is generated, but they will not lookgood when printed at a different resolution.  So when you print to an attached PS printer, with the PS driver set up forthis printer results, may be quite good.

Thisis definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra 700. The power supply is still thestock CX's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives, a PLI SCSI accelerator, a Micron technologies 24 bit video board, Daystar QuickCache,New Technologies Overdrive and 20 meg of RAM simultaneously.I added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drivetower. The internal SCSI cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable ontowhich I added an extra connector about midway. The final HD was internallyterminated and the drive between the motherboard and final HD had its terminator resistor packs removed. Cooling has not been a problem and no SCSI problemsoccur with either the PLI SCSI chain or motherboard SCSI hooked into the twointernal hard drives.It works very well for me, but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same.

Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, takingappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so anyof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of thegalaxy.          Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from thevarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, eitherPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on ourcatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropicdistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs ofhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we aresampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, Isuppose you are saying, Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside thedisk.  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less aninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay outto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors detect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane fromthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mileaway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of hisarbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybefind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.          I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As Isaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (shorttimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type ofbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be boundto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely seenot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none ofthese characteristics.                  I think that's all of it...if someone needs clarification, or knowssomething that I don't know, by all means correct me.  I had the honor oftaking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of thesedifferent distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possibledistribution there was, and some VERY outrageous sources. Colliding pulsars,black holes, pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.   It's a funfield.

Although two months have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at  almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people  well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun. They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the  Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.  I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is  destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are  speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as  well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is  proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.

In California,it is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population inCalifornia is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most ofthese inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Policenow confiscate property, without trial, under a good faith probablecause standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drugdealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and amajority will answer yes if you ask them whether civil liberties anddue process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People TheMessage That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don'tknow whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, butI would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, overTWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under themarijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their ownbusiness and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselvesthan users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Underthe War on Drugs campaign of zero tolerance due process protectionshave eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole haveproliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicianswho favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not onlylegal, but political:  My fellow Americans, we must send our youngpeople the message that we are serious about winning the War OnMurder--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gunprohibition laws.

Trying to make comparisons between Israels politics and Nazi German-  Austrian politics shows only your degree of ignorance (high), intellect  (low), humanity (none) and antisemitism (average). I respect anybody  who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a  civilized manner. I would never say that anybody that critizises Israel  and/or its politics is an antisemite, except he uses antisemitic  vocabulary/terminology/demagogy. Israel is not a perfect country and  its politicians also commits errors, even some of them are corrupt  (like politicians in any other country), but they carry a huge burden:  to care for the safety of ALL its citizens, and that is really not an  easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect  that Israel commits the ONE BIG ERROR and wipe the country (and its  Jewish citizens plus the so-called collaborators, arabs that wanted to  live in peace with their Jewish neighbours) of the map. As I said,  Israel is not a perfect country, but it is the ONLY democracy in the  whole Middle-East and the only country in the world where Jews from  everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries  they are living.  Our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on non-Jewish  nations and its governments: as soon as there are more or les big  social-economical-political problems in any country, the first ones  that pay for the broken glasses are the Jews, and later the other  minorities of the country.  > I don't think the suffering of some Jews during WWII                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government.

PST               Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING on the aid package.     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.       Before taking your questions and running through the basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin tomorrow.          The second point is that this package is designed to support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian government.          Third, the President is determined that we will deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in front of you.          Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.            They also agreed that there would be a new joint commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote a vastly expanded relationship.          If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just give you some general background on what these programs are.  I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.          The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.          The second item is concessional food sales.  As you know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates thereafter for the life of the deal.          The third program is a collection of private sector support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.            The President has also decided to create a privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian government in its priority objective of trying to convert state enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.          The fourth grouping you see there in the summary page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're launching.            The President is also calling for the development of a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in Russia.          The fifth program you see is Russian office of resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say that we have a long-term commitment to this project.            The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much environmental damage.          I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, about the new group being created that the Vice President will chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this problem full-time.            And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a commitment within our own government to have people work on it -- senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly important.          You'll notice that the United States is going to support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.            You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo conference, the G-7 conference.          Before I take any further questions, I'd like to defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance objectives with you.          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.          The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the construction of that storage facility.            And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the last couple of years.            So this is an area where we will be going a lot more work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of START I, an agreement to accede to NPT.           So we are working very hard with all the parties to the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia as a very important step in that process.          Q  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the same one, why do you feel it's necessary?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced today.  So it's completely new.          Q  Can you tell us more about what's involved?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what Russia needs.          So we think this deal is very, very good development for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an American company.  And the American government has played a leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.          Q  So it's to search and also to renovate fields that are already there?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.          Q  On that point, should other American companies expect to get administration support for such deals, or should they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 billion?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, there will be $2 billion in financing available for American companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.          Q  That should take up all of the rest of the deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.          Q  What's the current year budget costs of that $2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any current year budget costs --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.          Q  The concessional food sales -- is there any current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in which the payments are due?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.          Q  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?          Q     and the private sector -- how many folks are going to be involved in that?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt coming into office that there were literally thousands of organization, private organizations in the United States that in one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.          It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of our own government, but the resources of the American private sector and schools and communities across the nation.          Q     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated besides the $300 million the President talked about?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What the President has done this weekend is to consult really intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional measures the United States could take in some of these areas to support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.          Q  Two questions about the $700 billion agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit into that situation?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we could promote American grain sales.            And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked for a concessional loan program.            I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this very important grain relationship, which is important for them, and it's important for the American farm community.          Q  I gather from what you say that this could make it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, is that right?           SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around $640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to respond to a specific request from the Russian government for major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with the Russian government and arrived at this solution.            I think the Russians are pleased because it provides them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on the short-term payments.          Q  Where do those funds actually come from?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want to make that general point again:  Everything in this package, the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be able to do so.          Q  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually have a range from 0 to --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the same level of food imports from the West.          Q  I would imagine there's going to be some considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with some of the other republics?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and roughly 50 percent to the other countries.           In the area of food sales, we have been active with Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are productive and they're hard-hitting.          Q  Has anything happened at the summit to lead American energy companies and other companies to believe that Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of Western governments have the financial resources over the next decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private sector can do that.            We look at our own society and we see tremendous capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new technology and new capital to finance new production.            That's what the Russian government has told us it wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong signal to the American business community that we support their efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to support them.          Q  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to deliver on making Russia a more --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to the work.          Q  What type of mechanism is already in place to administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the Russian government for distribution at their will?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of these programs.          But they are all quite different.  For instance, in the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have noticed.          So we literally have here 30 to 40 different activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the Russian government, some with Russian citizens.          Q  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the President has to do on that?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and we'll get back to the Russian government.          Q  You were not prepared for these questions when you got here?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before we take any action.          Q  Is this package designed so that you will not have to go to Congress for anything at this point?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And that's the advantage of this particular initiative.          Q  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are prepared to go to Congress for various things?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where it stands now.          Q  We've been told repeatedly that a number of these items represent different or new ways of spending the money already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways that it was not previously set to be?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've said that these are all projects that either Congress had allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this administration took office and had some new ideas about how the funds might be expended.          We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to further our programs.          And example of that is the Food for Progress concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we found it.          Q  Where, for example, are you getting the money for this Russian officer resettlement --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the Freedom Support Act funds.          Q  In other words, all of the money is being directly spent in new ways, so to speak --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year '92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the legislative history of those funds.          Q     cooperation --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.          Q  Could you tell us please, has anything happened here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's happened here --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very important negotiation that's been going on essentially between Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.            But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.          Q?    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been earmarked and put it into this fund?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.            We could have put in really big numbers and this could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy that the western governments, the combination of governments, put up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is determined, to carry out every single program in this package.  And we'll do it.            But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.          Q     taken it way from any --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.          Q  In terms of funding, there is no available monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, but we thought we should now.            Q  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by initiatives put forward by President Bush?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This administration took office and inherited some obligations that the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments that had been made by the previous administration.            But we have gone well beyond them in funding the enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, is another Clinton initiative.            Further, we listened to the Russian government and listened to the Russian military who told us that the resettlement of their officers was important to them for political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.            I would also say that the President has given impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private sector as well as the American government, to achieve that objective.            So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton assistance package for Russia.          Q  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money will not just disappear because it's being administered by the Russian government?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I know that the President and other senior officials of our government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the State Department will take great care in making sure that the funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their source.          I would not that this package is not simply a package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another example of that.          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one area that we've been looking at very, very closely is consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.          Q  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate in a much more effective way the activities of our own government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw them together and to focus their efforts.          Q  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something up in the next couple of days on that.          Q  This figure is larger than the figure that has been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been together for about two weeks.          Q  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There was so much talk before about the President wanted to get Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  Is that in the out years?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, that support for the creation of private businesses is important to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize the state industries is important to them.            And so what we did was to try to make those the centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been working with the Russian government for months on this trying to work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of these programs was involved every step of the way.            But let me get at the other part of your question.  The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other allied governments that are also active.          Q  There's essentially nothing that happened in the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that you came in with?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've primarily talked about future, about what more the United States and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, which is our base objective here.          Q  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me what about job training for workers who are displaced by privatization?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.          Q     money for job training for workers whose jobs are disappearing because of privatization --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet allocated any money for that.          Q  Why not?          Q     of the $6 million is going to build 450 housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian government.          Q     of the $6 million will go to retrain --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.          Q  Are you talking about apartment buildings or single --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about single, individual dwellings.          Q  You're saying that only 450 families will be served by this?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next couple of months and try to figure out with American organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job done.            I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to spend the money wisely.          Q  What is it about this program that convinces you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, especially considering their other debt problem?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think it's important to note that the United States on its own does not have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do so, which is consistent with our national interests.          Q  Did the President say that the value of the U.S. contribution was that it would create security and prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this program that does this?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, and that is we want to do everything we can to support the continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we have to make a long-term commitment to it.          Q  And then on the question of Russia's ability to repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 years from now?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years from now to pay back those loans.          Q     substantial government-to-government loan we've ever gotten into with the Russians?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of effort.          Q     government loans in any other sector that you recall?  I know it wasn't done in --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair to say this is a new and unique effort.                               END10:25 A.M. PDT

I think of it as Don't worry, be happy. For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to anepistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way ofknowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existenceof gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Mostphilosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one thatmust be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logicalbasis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing? There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absenceof any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elsesword on faith, we just mean that having found this person to bereliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidenceeverywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge aboutgods? The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally thenone of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faithis in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptablebasis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable atother times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheistbelieves that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliableknowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position thantheism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all otherknowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather thanSanta Claus or the Easter Bunny? I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn'trequire absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe thatthere is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best andsimplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held untilcontrary evidence is found. David Nye (nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu).

Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains inany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a referencepower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance whichshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohmsin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an acceptednotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance ofthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omittedreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notationsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.For power:  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )For amplitude  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except forthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notationconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.Common references for audio are:0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms0 dBV = 1 volt0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)0 VU = -10dBV(consumer gear line level)Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned usingthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is alldone to whatever reference is reasonable for the applicationor moment.Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linearimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, thepower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be donewith the above two identities and ohm's law.-- --------------------------------------------------------------------       Dave MedinPhone:(205) 730-3169 (w)    SSD--Networking(205) 837-1174 (h)    Intergraph Corp.

The last time it happened was when I wanted to   demonstrate some software to a colleague.    I would like to know if anybody has experienced similar  problems. I don't like to take the thing to the dealer  only to be told that there's nothing wrong with it. I  checked the other post in this group about Maxtor, and  I don't seem to be the only one who has problems. However,  no one describes the same problem, and I also have a   different configuration.

Crown Publishers, Inc., New York (1952). (Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5  million Muslim people)p. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph). 'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.' 'No, dammit! My stomach isn't-' 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.' We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space.... 'I don't believe you, I said, but followed to a nail-studded door. The   man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse.   I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and   went inside. The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for  its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an  iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black  with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As  the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face  up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what  was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted,  as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so  I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his   slashed genitals.p. 363 (first paragraph).  'How many people lived there?' 'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned. 'Did you see any Turk officers?' 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.' The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me -  Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into  laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion, Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would have been. From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around..... The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last  scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags,  looms, even spinning-wheels. 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must  leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And  for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains.  Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in  a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'p. 354.At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian, but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on Moslem villages.p. 358.It will be three hours to take, Dro told me. We'd close in on three sides.The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets, Merrimanovsaid, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.That is for morale, Dro put in. We must keep the Moslems in terror.Soldiers or civilians? I asked.There is no difference, said Dro. All are armed, in uniform or not.But the women and children?Will fly with the others as best they may.p. 360.The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet  down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said  Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.' Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling; then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though  I heard our Utica brass roar. As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed, dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly. The came a shrill wailing. Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot. 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries. At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and  tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly, through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.p. 361 (fourth paragraph).Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair,  large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble  where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet  had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between  the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun  dress. The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He  lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the  pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed  just below his neck, into the spine.  There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was  empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking  colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead.p. 358. ...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled  north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands,   Turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - Christian, Red or Tartar -  coming in from Transcaucasus. Then they spoke of the hell that would   break loose if Versailles were to put, as threatened, the six 'Armenian'  vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan...  An Armenia without Armenians! Turks under Christian rule? His lips  smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. That's bloodshed - just  Smyrna over again on a bigger scale.Source: U.S. Library of Congress: 'Bristol Papers' - General          Correspondence Container

He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life inthis world will keep it for eternal life.  If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there Myservant will be also.  If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us toenjoy what he has given us?Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that Iwill die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to havebefore that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will becontent to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they tooare dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automaticallymean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, andfend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that nomatter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so beit.

Truth is, it's not.  Robert has neverdemonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; hejust rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face ofcommon sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain theverses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view,which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if onlyhe or she understood the Christian message properly, and then allstrife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem withthat: substitute Moslem or Buddhist or Satanist instead ofChristian, and it means the same thing.Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But ifyou want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD,you've got some convincing to do.>I pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of>knowledge.

Advice from a grad student.I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and learn as much as possible about it.  In my five years of education in this field, though brief compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going intoElectrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering orCS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that thiskind of question is irrelevant.   I have come to believe that choosing CS because one does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one doesnot like to program is really doing an injustice of buildingand computer and making it useful for something.  Everythingis interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decisionbased on which major will give you the best opportunities to learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me toexplore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why theschool would make a student choose a major before her/hissophamore year.                  Hey you may be so interested in this field that you decided to learn all about the making of computers in which case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if youare good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else. If you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.  Like wise if you are a hotshot computer designers.        - Chung Yang

President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A To: National Desk Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100   WASHINGTON, April 20 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following areremarks by President Clinton in a question and answer sessionwith the press (Part 2 of 2):     Go ahead, Sarah.     Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  Thefirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did nothave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chancebecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it wasvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survivedwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn'tthose people have a right to practice their religion?     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing theirreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they hadviolated federal laws, any number of them.     Q  What federal laws --     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can'tanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that thewhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; theywere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult butit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one ofthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details ofthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they werespeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast thatthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might haveescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an undergroundcompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could besent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that ifthe children were not released immediately outside that the humanething would be done and that the children would be sent someplacewhere they could be protected.     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learnedyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gaswas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masksthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if theyall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in anonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.     MS. MYERS:  Last question.     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever askedJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when youlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through yourmind during those horrendous moments?     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they hadconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in thepublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said thatthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issuesconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there wouldbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime inthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they wereright or wrong, of course, we will never know.     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw thebuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediateconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they wereescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.That's the first thing I wanted to know.     Thank you.     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was aJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn'thave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn'tgo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which Itake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and Isigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority tomake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time hadelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said,if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.And I do support her.     She is not ultimately responsible to the Americanpeople; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in anappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think aswell as she could have.     Thank you.  (Applause.) -30-

That can be had, mostly through Tripoli (the high-power analog of the NAR), although the NAR is cautiously moving to extendthe upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.You need special FAA authorization, but provided you aren't doing it underone of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, it's notespecially hard to arrange.As with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handledproperly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more emptyair to fly in, but it's basically just model rocketry scaled up.

Your fascist government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killedand hundreds of civilians also perished.   Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included    the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,   Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives,    children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians    joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan    districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of   3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished   to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to   the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and   seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell   into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims   themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels   also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the   large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from   occupying the city.   The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out   the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the   neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They   raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'   distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.   At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,   Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible   atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in   the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the   neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.   Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the   Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four   villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,   they continued to spread death and destruction among the   Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down   their arms. Source: Uras, Esat: The Armenians in History. Documentary Publications (Istanbul), 1988.p. 954.In his speech given at the Sivas Congress, Mustafa Kemal once again drew a picture of the  country under occupation: In the East, the Armenians are making preparations for advancing to the River Halys (Kizilirmak), and have already started a policy of massacring the Moslem population.pp. 966-967.The situation of the southern provinces of Turkey after the signing of the Mudros Armistice is described by Ataturk in his speech: The Armenians in the south, armed by foreign troops and encouraged by the protection they enjoyed, molested the Mohammedans of their district. They  pursued a relentless policy of murder and extinction everywhere. This was  responsible for the tragic incident at Maras....the Armenians had completely  destroyed an old Mohammedan town like Maras by their artillery and  machine-gun fire. They killed thousands of innocent and defenceless women and children. The Armenians were the instigators of the atrocities, which were unique in history.  Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).

President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A To: National Desk Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100   WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session with the press:1:36 P.M. EDT     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federalagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the lawagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiledweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-daystandoff ensued.     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made everyreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end withoutbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts wereultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they weredealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probablyinsane.     He engaged in numerous activities which violated bothfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during theaction against the compound in February.  Given his inclinationtowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, noprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federalagents against the compound.     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno onan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure onKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, evenin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not causepermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the peoplein the compound to come outside and to surrender.     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  Idiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions Ithought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do whatshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for theimplementation of the decision.     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federalagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were hiscaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did notsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimateresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.     Now we must review the past with an eye towards thefuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice andTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation touncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have beendne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independentprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  Iexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is requiredto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments tocooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we cancontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.     I want to express my appreciation to the AttorneyGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on thefront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficultcircumstances.     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorryfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the endof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will betempted to join cults and to become involved with people like DavidKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen overthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficultsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they willbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the futurewill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of whathas been learned now.     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,after 51 days, you decided --     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it isthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversationwith --     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will gofirst and then the other.     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --     Q  Mr. President --     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but Ican't do it at once.     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday aboutthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney Generalthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take anotherstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And shedescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wantedto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to causepermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make itvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it washoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.     I was further told that under no circumstances would ourpeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going toshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them andthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awfullot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.There were no shots coming back from the government side.     I asked a number of questions.  The first question Iasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasonsI was given were the following:     Number one, that there was a limit to how long thefederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources thequality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might beneeded in other parts of the country.     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this hadnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convincedthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going tobe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cultmembers to come out.     Number three, that the danger of their doing somethingto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, withthe passage of time.     And number four, that they had reason to believe thatthe children who were still inside the compound were being abusedsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary andunsafe conditions.     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they hadgiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong andevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She saidthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them wereconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would onlyincrease with the passage of time.     The third question I asked was, has the military beenconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obviousthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Militarypeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and someof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if themilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that theyhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only oneminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelmingsignificance.     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, Isaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that sheshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by thattoday.     Q  Mr. President --     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you weretrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The onlyreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the onlyreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing toadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until ratherlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those whohad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken intocustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for eventsto unfold.     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why peoplespeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney Generalon the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.I called her again late last night after she appeared on the LarryKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- itis not possible for a President to distance himself from things thathappen when the federal government is in control.     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprisedwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that theAttorney General should resign because some religious fanaticsmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in thislife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  Thesepeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They wereheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could toavoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolatethemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about thechildren.     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want youto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- whyyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And shesaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that thosechildren are still being abused and that they're in increasinglyunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easierwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word forthat.  So that is where I think things stand.     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this wasmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out ofpatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you reallydecide that way?     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assumeis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI hasdone a lot of things right for this country over a long period oftime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed theWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiryto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else weshould have known?  Is there some other question they should haveasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I sayfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to makethe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I wantthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we havesome independent law enforcement people, not political people, buttotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the bestevidence we have.     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort offanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront itagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it isimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were thepeople who killed others and then killed themselves.     Q  Mr. President, were there any other optionspresented to you for resolving this situation at any point fromFebruary 28th until yesterday?     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports allalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you goback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very goodjob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursuedany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of themearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some ofthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed tobe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and theauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and thingsjust began to spin downward.     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happenedyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did notinvolve other options except whether we should take more time withthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said theywanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to getpeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.That's what they thought.     Q  Did the government know that the children did nothave gas masks?     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- areyou in agreement with that?     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can dowhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that theTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bringin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if anycongressional committees want to look into it, we will fullycooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably themost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of thecountry.   (more, more) -30-

Certainly a million riflemen (as: opposed to a professional army of only ten or twenty thousand, the: best a country the size of Switzerland could support), makes: invasions more difficult.   Hitler invaded Yugoslavia and occupied it.  The mountainous portions weresometimes patrolled by the wermacht, but they were certainly not in control.There were two major native factions opposing each other and the germans,It was basically useless to the germans (no production) and a drain on theirresources (a armored division and a couple of infantry divisions) Which ifmy memory is correct, were kind of stuck there up until the allies acceptedtheir surrender.  (I think that the allies also let the germans keep some of their weapons for self defense unitil they were able to get to the lowlands, away from the resistance factions.  This is from memory, and it is unreliable.  --Dale Farmer

Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, thatgoaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you'reMontreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it;he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just anexcuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worstgoals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to cleartraffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don'tthink this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.Demers should start Racicot in the next game.

Watching them break out of theirzone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red Army.  But I still hate the team.On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on apowerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely iswaving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title butoff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced theleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half ofthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played home games in placeslike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff homegames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. Onedemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus androcked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium.Despite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafswill return to St John's once the strike ends.===================================================SENATORS SOLDThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman tothe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only CanadianNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clearthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian AtlanticProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHLhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meetingin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it clear the league was more interested in the stability of the AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintainingthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with CharlottetownNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.==================================================DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTONAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation outof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashingtheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and theywanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawksin the New Brunswick city.The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years ifthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold1400 for this year.============================================================SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIALThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city ofSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansionfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.=========================================================CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINEDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the BaltimoreSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announceda limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so playersincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limitedfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.======================================================AHL GAME OF THE WEEKIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, producedby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the CanadianMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games ofthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, therehas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered andshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, AtlanticSports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am notsure if playoff games will be covered.=====================================================UTICA GONE?

Center for Regional StudiesLines: 8504/16/93 1045  ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANESBy David LjunggrenMOSCOW, April 16, Reuter - Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weaponsx and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted itmight try to shoot the planes down, local journalists in Yerevan said.Separately, Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latestoffensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions inthe Transcaucasian region soaring.The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of theArmenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey aboutthe impermissibility of such actions, the journalists quoted Duliyan as saying.If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriatemeasures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraftunits.Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in theconflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in whichmore than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane toAzerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directlyon a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocketlaunchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troopsand arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from wherethey were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by thecountry which is affording military assistance over our airspace, he said.Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensivealong the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independentinspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's)leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire, the agency said.Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire inKarabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit ofCommonwealth leaders.The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing theprotection of the Karabakh population, Tass quoted him as saying.     At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all havecollapsed.The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to thelegal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, hesaid. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not been recognised by any other country.Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in futurepeace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister IskenderGamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute withArmenia, had resigned.Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office.Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant ofBaku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev.

I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on thequotes they have.At least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivingsabout the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science.I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the ChristiansCreation Science on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a historyof scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koranto support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all tooeasy to look at science as it exists today and then interpret passagesto match those findings.  People do similar things with the sayings ofNostradamus all the time.Anyway, it is a rather unique claim of Islam and may be worth checking.

Then theystarted running a Two Million Strong! campaign for a while -- but theylet it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that theysimply were never going to reach that level of membership.In 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the startingpoint of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.  By 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had about a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it thethird largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA).And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.

Again, notnecessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomitingoccurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism haseaten.

They are a way for the body to dispose of noxiouscompounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possiblesome other food or environmental compound could be responsible for thesymptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effetscan be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would benecessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the personwas exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopirationand heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far fromsimple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body. > some>had itchy skin or rashes. People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It dependsupon what it is about the compound that pisses off their body.Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in manypeople, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and anhistamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with anallergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas thatcontain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance canperturb that person's system as much as inhaling it. >More serious accusations include respiration >difficulty See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatoryproblems are not serious. They can be deadly.and brain damage. The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine systemcontrolling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controllingthe cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,and other steroids.

That was the bronze medal game in the SM-liiga which Tichonov's team Porin Assat (the Aces of town Pori:)lost.  Vasili, the son of Victor Tichonov (the famous Soviet coach),said that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him totake the assistant coach post. But he wants to be the head coach whereever he goes. He definitely won't be coaching Assat anymore (afterthree? seasons). I don't know why.Vasili is a good coach I believe. Assat was a good team, produced manyplayers to our national team. Assat wasn't a skilled team (IMHO) butthey had the fighting spirit. After all, they butchered Jokerit in theplayoffs and gave hard time to TPS, the champs. But Assat wasn'tconsistent, only when they were in the right mood they could beat anyteam in the SM-liiga.I am not 100% sure about the deal with the Sharks. As I said, he wantsto be the head coach. But he and the Sharks are going to negotiate anddecide during the WC. I doubt that he will be the head coach butmaybe they'll do some compromise.Could somebody post more information about Vasili? I know he was coachingin the former Soviet league; teams, results? His character as a coach?

He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer(and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is notpossible).This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared toApple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. Itis Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colourversion, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that itgave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for oldercomputers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have beenupgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to dealwith Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPTGrayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able todo so, whatever Mac you were using.

Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.       In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billiondollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase ofapprox. 884 billion dollars.       In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars.That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccountedfor.  (This represented an increase of 230%)       In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs,Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare)cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, ormore than national defense started.  (This represented an increaseof 230%)       In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars onMedicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of368%)       In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housingcredits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.       In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billiondollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.       Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.       Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.       Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.       Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.       Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.       Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.            About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under the Energy category, primarily under Supply, and Community Development,in the area of disaster relief, and between the two of themrepresent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.

Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose nameescapes me at the moment) called Homosexuals in History asserts that Roehmand Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.>All the books say that Roehm and his associate, Edmund Heines,>were homosexual.  I have been able to find nothing beyond that, and>suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend. Well, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books,look up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do nothave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty ofdocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the knight of thelong knives several SA members (including Heines) were found sleepingtogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA'shomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've read make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. >(Irving, a>notoriously unreliable historian, says that Funk, the Nazi finance>minister, was homosexual.  He gives no sources.)I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely doyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I haveread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about homosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. >I challenge anyone to document this claim.If you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),then the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out wherethe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close toarchival material - most people on the net are not.>I *have* found a great>deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the>Nazis.  This seems to include all of the worst ones--Hitler, Himmler,>Goebbels, Goering, Heydrich, Eichmann, and many more.Eh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, sothat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazismight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this istrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?I don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis werehomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notoriousfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the Germangovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friendswere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a longtradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -back to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a product of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like theEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.In addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. TheHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various pre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the evils of homosexuality.Why should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all societies - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.No, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof youwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access to these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modernhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing isstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you proveotherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.                                                                           /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/David Matthew Deane (deane@binah.cc.brandeis.edu)...Be in me as the eternal moods of the bleak wind...Let the Gods speak softlyof us in days hereafter...

Gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9  inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) is attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up. This will eventually cause death.Enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable improvement in their condition. Ceredase, which is manufactured by biotech biggy company--Genzyme--costs the patient $380,000 per year. Gaucher's disease has justifyably been called the most expensive disease in the world.NEED INFO:I have researched Gaucher's disease at the library but am relying on netlanders to provide me with any additional information:**news, stories, reports**people you know with this disease**ideas, articles about Genzyme Corp, how to get a hold of   enough money to buy some, programs available to help with   costs.**Basically ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFERThanks so very much!Deborah

Are they selected by the coaching staff, do the players vote for a captain, or are they appointed by management?And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been traded, resigned, or been striped of his title during the season? Any other team captain trivia would be appreciated.-- Mike

I can't imagine the FAA allowing>people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes.>Not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down.Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to beone of the following:a) An employee of a government agency.b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved inresearch or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in constructionand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on thelocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraftwithin the operating radius around the launch site.- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace thatunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over thewestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popularsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback isfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an F motor are exempt frommost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, SubpartC, for details.As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typicalrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carryeither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launchesin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.>And no, I'm not going to even think of buying one.  I'm not that crazy.Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rocketsfor information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everythingbigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is topractice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbstakeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.>-Paul mine'll do 50,000 feet and carries 50 pounds of dynamite DokasThat's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESEROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggestmisconceptions people have about our hobby. >/*            Just remember, you *WILL* die someday.             */True.

A much more likely explanationis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, becausethe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not thehistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitationimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk ofthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of coursenot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether theanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, orbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sunto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,but I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)

By such a back-door (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it would be possible (for  the manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in one session.

Since the procedure described by Ms Denning imposes high costs on the production of every chip (at least three persons for one hour each, plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular, Hollywood-like bonfire; add travelling expenses, drinks and lighting, divide the sum by 300) there won't be a larger demand -- not from the private sector anyway.

From: usenet@news.cso.uiuc.edu (Net Noise owner)Subject: Re: Facinating facts: 30 bit serial number, possibly fixed S1 and S2Organization: University of Illinois @ Urbana/ChampaignLines: 32The only way to view this method of generating unit keys is as a back-door.What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serialnumber? To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a   64-bit block R1:   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:     R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]    R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow   agencies.What happens is that the need for the Escrow houses is completely eliminated.Or should I say, the need to _access_ the Escrow houses to decrypt the data.The houses will still serve a real purpose as far as generating the illusionof protection, and small-town cops won't be let in on the secret, so theywill still go through the motions of going to the Escrow houses, but the factis __the Federal government CAN and WILL build a chip which generates the unitkeys from the encrypted serial number!__  'Nuff Said.

As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee      intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes      with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this would be  a basic condition      for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland)The US doesn't yet have many laws covering BBSs - they're not common carriers,they're not phone companies, they're just private machines or servicesoperated by businesses.  There's no obligation to keep records.As Perry Metzger points out, if the police come with a search warrant,you have to let them see what the warrant demands, if it exists,and they generally can confiscate the equipment as evidence(which is not Constitutionally valid, but we're only beginning todevelop court cases supporting us).  A court MAY be able to compelyou to tell them information you know, such as the encryption passwordfor the disk - there aren't any definitive cases yet, since it's a newsituation, and there probably aren't laws specifically covering it.But the court can't force you to *know* the keys, and there are nolaws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keysfor their own files without giving them to you.Even in areas that do have established law, there is uncertainty.There was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business recordssubpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business-restriction law,so he gave the court the records.  Which were in Hebrew.The US doesn't have laws forcing you to keep your records in English,and these were the originals of the records.

Any significance to this?  *Why does this recur? Me and my family go through severe pain when our little boy have to undergo surgery. Why does surgery not rectify the situation?   *Also, which hospital in US or Canada specialize in this malady?  *What will be a good book explaining this disease in detail?  *Will keeping a particular diet keep down the probability of  recurrence?  *As time goes on, will the probability of recurrence go down considering he is getting stronger and healthier and probably less prone to attacks? Or is this assumption wrong?  *Any help throwing light on these queries will be highly appreciated. Thanks very much!  jose@csd.uwo.ca

Can any crypto>implementation for which highly publicly scrutinized source code is not>available EVER be trusted?After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals,but before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they should not; they should keep it proprietary. The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscombwas the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunatelyfor all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above questionmuch better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gainacceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessarycomplexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would authority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15 years.We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, inventedand proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined andvetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence byany of these.Even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trustthe DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of thepublic scrutiny.(Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basisof authority alone.)We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can break theDES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time theycan break anything.  The important question is at what cost and inwhat time.The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so importantas what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand thecost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way.At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability ofany successor to overcome this knowledge gap.DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the centuryand the most important inventions in the history of cryptography.We are damned lucky to have them.William Hugh Murray, Executive Consultant, Information System Security49 Locust Avenue, Suite 104; New Canaan, Connecticut 06840                1-0-ATT-0-700-WMURRAY; WHMurray at DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL

Well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes. You have to be very careful about what you mean by question authority.Taken literally, it is nonsense. That which is authoratative is authoratative,and to say I question to word of this authority is ridiculous. If it is open to question, it isn't an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectlyreasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrasehere should be authenticate authority. Once you have authenticatedyour authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it asan authority. The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistencyin what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules ofdiscourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, ininself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.)I cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, because if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don't need an authority. I need an authority only when there is information I need whichI cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I mustdo it by some means other than by examining its teachings. In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don'thave time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientistworing today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sortsof knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to verify for himself.In spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source ofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I ama Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seemthe strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter forbelief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is areasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty.If you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility ofevery receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possiblychange. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific. To demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence, is to denyGod's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their verynature, prove anything.-- ==============================================================================Mark Baker                  | The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but aa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts. -- C.

Any thinking approachto the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like itthat women and men are spiritual equals.I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women havesouls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to beforgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in theafter-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, thepart saying For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great rewardsays they have souls.  (If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then I have no idea _what_ a soul is.)As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priorityin all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to giveall verses of the Qur'an equal priority.  That is because, according toMuslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact,denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to beconsidered a disbeliever in Islam.>Quite similar to you other post, even when the Quran does not encourage>slavery, it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to>slavery. It is a non sequitur.Look, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence andthought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand theQuran's message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitlyanswer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachingsit can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equalsof men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and thatsince women can clearly be forgiven and rewarded they _must_ havesouls (from the above verse).Let's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather thantry to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring thispassage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based onignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations fully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss theseinterpretations consistent with the text rather than how people canignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can tryto twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- butprovides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.

I'verefrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar withthe OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to saysomething.Many things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightestsuggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate theGospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the deathof Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to breakdown these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, thereis neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  IfMoslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't killthem.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions.There are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns underattack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems areliving together peacefully.The precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact twodifferent things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry intoCanaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to havepromised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to bea holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in thoseattacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to bedefeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts inJoshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it waspossible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that oncethat was done -- even when deception was involved -- they wereexpected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations ofagreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has grantedBosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behaviorwould have disqualified this from being a holy war.The other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated byAssyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israelfor her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as ajudgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replayof the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals becauseillness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by Godfor good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn'tjustify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear thatin attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as*unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God'speople, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they wereactually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action.Furthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks arejudgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, throughhis prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets toBosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting,I am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But thatdoesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it fromjudgement.I am particularly concerned about the implications of this issuebecause of current tensions between the West and Moslem-orientednations.  What we do not need is for Moslems to conclude thatChristians think it's OK to kill Moslems.  The implications for themid-East, and even relations with American Moslems, could be quiteserious.

In short, many evangelicals claim that they areinfallible on the matter of religious texts.In particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you canthink of epistemology as how do you know?  That question, it turns out, isa very troubling one.The problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some ofthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain thateverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did todiscover a source of truth is in question.And that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source ofauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.Let's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictionalInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea ofPapal Infallibility, too.)Zeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, andseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (andpossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of AbsoluteTruth.He may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.His conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have mademistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  Hisconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have mademistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have mademistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)Everything about his study of the world that he did -- everything thathappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter whathe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his owninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his ownreasoning, that belief cannot be considered absolutely certain.Zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that beliefis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he cansay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.Any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part onyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infalliblethinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.This is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doingepistemology: how do you know?  Imagine a hypothetical discussion: A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth. B: How do you know? A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church    teachings and came to this conclusion. B: How do you know you studied history correctly? A: Well, I double-checked everything. B: How do you know you double-checked correctly? A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed. B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly? A: ...And, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say Ican't prove that there are no mistakes -- and as long as you may have made amistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.There is no way out of the loop.This is where the arrogance of Christians arises: many people believethat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about thedoctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they areinfallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has ledyou to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant. *People who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try tofind _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attackingthe idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible isknowably Inerrant.Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.eduAt the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded.                                                    -- Ludwig Wittgenstein

Thus I've never really believed in God andheaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either -I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.        Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered howreligious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as thoughI want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof -just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can'tdefinitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up byreligious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me tounderstand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.        Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion iscorrect?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the ChristianGod exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel aboutpeople who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me -agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept theirbeliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction betweenthe religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Doyou have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they followa different religion than you would if they were Christian??        Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events inthe bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to bestories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??        I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose arefairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I findhard is the actual belief in God.        Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quitebelieve in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely notbelieving doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering whyI so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.        Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they cameinto my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

We *are* commanded tolove one another, after all.  And Brown's book is, in fact, a heroicattempt to SEE the groupings he talks about as motivated in love andthe gospel and their social contexts.  (If anything, Brown is *too*heroic here -- he manages to overstrain himself at times :-))I don't suggest that we *follow* any of these old cult paths -- andit raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much ofearly Christianity *was* like the weird (Christian and non-Christian)cults we see today.  To that extent, I think you raise a seriousproblem (and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatoryand ironic.)But the first principle for *answering* these questions is respect andlove for those we do not understand.  And it helps to *work* at under-standing (as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and beginto withdraw our respect for them as people.)  I would advise, in otherwords, MORE historical reading (Brown's other books are also good, mostespecially his bio. of Augustine; also try Robin Lane Fox's _Christiansand Pagans_, maybe the Paul Veyne ed. _History of Private Life_, someof Foucault's books on sexuality in the ancient world ...)Humanity *is* weird -- we have known ONE sane person, and we killed Him.Fortunately for us, this has proved a Comedy rather than a Tragedy.Easter, 1993.(yes; this is a tad early -- our Vigil service here has been moved forwardbecause so many churches in the area have taken to doing their own Vigils,and the seminarians must therefore worship-and-run if they are to do ithere and there as well.

Or Darrell>Evans! Yeah, yeah! After the Hall of Fame takes in them, it can take in>Eddie Murray and Jeff Reardon.Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, hadnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decenthitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman aresimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field,he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, hisOBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)was a absolute-primo-dick.  Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know thatMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of theMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.  Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a ssolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks (Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda likeTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.>     Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody>giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,>marginal.Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?>Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both>shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.>Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so>liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if somethingNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED theposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something alongthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's morerecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie'soffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of hiscareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a realstiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far asSS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.>isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When >certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential >candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a mediot candidate, pushed because of his winning attitude (a minor factor, if oneat all), and his great defense (no errors, admittedly, but the range ofa tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the lastyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talkabout Morris' ability to win which is nothing more than Morris' abilityto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs.  At this point, Morris is anaverage pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great yearfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, butnot favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOFconsideration.  Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone willthrow back your earlier logic about Yount and Smith being shortstops who hung around a long time.  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...(Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a fewmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, mostlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty muchregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, andlegitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined theleague.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in theend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an offthe top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probablyleft a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

Now does anyone know if it is possible to use W4WG and Lan Workplacefor DOS at the same time. ie Can I access a file on another PC while being logged on to themainframe at the same time, simultaneously.Any help well appreciated.Gary Hunt.Centre for Advanced Studies in ArchitectureUniversity of Bathabsgh@gdr.bath.ac.uk

Below is a very shortdescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,feel free to poke me via e-mail.================================================================*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.   Consider deleting these edges.1) Now, there are two goals:    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured        using the digitized (x,y)'s).2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For   example:    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the       Reference(x,y).     b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge       the correct length (where correct is the DigitizedLength).        Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Considerhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insiston the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want tobalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in lengthof the edges.WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must beobserved (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, andyou can't allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles.  Both ofthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion ofindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from theoriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time wasprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try andchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have morecompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider havingevery point interact with every other point....but first read up onlinear solutions to the n-body problem.There are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings onsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

Although this case did not pertain to firearms, Justice Rhenquist    notes that the term the people is a term of art conveying individual    rights, and specifically cited several used, 2nd ammentment included,    in his opinion.  - Title 10, U.S. Code.

Mycomment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendorsthat supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe thatwe *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of theCrimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.I'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at aprevious site on the understanding *that* architecture would be aroundfor a while, rather than being flushed.Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has tokeep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myselfpressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the booksjust before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired ofgetting boned in the process.Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so wearen't entitled to a peek under the covers as the Big Kids (NASA,for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labsand organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computersevery year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis.The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through theentire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.  Thatmeans that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when Ihave the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase oneprevious poster's words, 'to fill a niche' to compete with some othervendor.  I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years.And every time I look at it, I'm going to think about SGI and how Icould have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we'resupported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).Now you'll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in acorner somewhere and think dark, libelous thoughts.spl-- Steve Lamont, SciViGuy -- (619) 534-7968 -- spl@szechuan.ucsd.eduSan Diego Microscopy and Imaging Resource/UC San Diego/La Jolla, CA 92093-0608My other car is a car, too.                 - Bumper strip seen on I-805

Organization: Arizona State UniversityFrom: James Cassidy <IFJXC@ASUACAD.BITNET>Subject:    Norton Desktop Smartcan vs. Norton Util's EPLines: 22I just purchased The Norton Desktop for windows, and I also haveNorton Utilities.  When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the linethat installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility.It replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes theversion of Image that came with NDW.  This makes sense, as presumably theImage version with NDW is newer than the one with NU.  It did not, however,install smartcan in the autoexec.  Now two questions:   1:  Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.       i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable?   2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?       I use both dos and windows, and I want to make sure that when I       erase files in either environment, they are going to be protected.From the experiments I have run, The two programs (Erase Protect andsmart Erase) don't use each others info.I currently have both EP and smartcan loading within my autoexec, andI don't see any conflicts;FYI :  Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.2       Norton Util's version 6Thanks for any help.

Bomber Harris was no hero of mine.Perhaps so.  And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too.  But that's easyto say from our enlightened viewpoint here in the 90's, right?  Backthen, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.After all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of thousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and millions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and other people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.

It is evident that the West, especially America,misjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world'soil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have beenprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the Westbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who isresponsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, astrong response from the West was required.> >> Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.>> You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I>> feel sure that was not your intent.> > What's your intent?

Or to allow them to continue with massslaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I'd have tosay yes, stopping Hussein was the most loving thing to do for themost people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.> >> So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?

But thenI learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convicton a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probablywould have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravatedassault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, whichnews commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under Californialaw.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it's evident that the first jury decided that the officers were not guilty.  Note, not not guilty of doing wrong, but not guilty of aggravated assault with the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.If the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, thenI feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one.> > mathew> [ Thou shalt not kill... unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing,>    in which case thou shalt kill, and also kill anyone who gets in the way,>    as unfortunately it cannot be helped.>                                    -- Jim Brown Bible for Loving Christians ]Thanks mathew, I like the quote.

I hearthe FAN at night wherever I go (the signal used to be WNBC, when theyplayed golden oldies) because you can't avoid it.  Of those three,WIP has the best hosts hands down.  Chuck Cooperstein isn't a homer,and neither is Jody Mac.  WTEM is too generic to be placed in thecatergory.  In fact if you have heard WTEM and the FAN you notice thetheme music is identical...same ownership?? I think so!  WIP istotally original.  Their hosts actually have a personality (this is aknock at TEM (the TEAM) not the FAN because Mike and the Mad Dog andSommers are good) I mean comparing the morning guys in Philadelphiato the ones in Washington is a total joke.  Anyway, I like the FANand WIP, but I think the edge goes to 'IP.  When I get back from Philly, I go into withdraw cause Richmond hasnada except the national sports line (and those guys are totallyclueless)   I was really mad when WCAU was cancelled because they had SteveFredericks doing sports phone after the Phillies games.  (WCAU isanother strong station, now it's an oldies station, but they stillhave the Phillies) I started listening to the FAN because I heard hewent there.  I finally heard him last summer and he wasn't the sameguy.  Those NY fans got to him.  I was glad to hear him back inPhilly when I went to see a few Eagles games.  I will admit, I am  die hard EAGLES fan and WIP is basically anEagles station 365 days a year.  BUT, I bet you the Phillies are incontrol right now.About the knock on G. Cobb, I like him.  He knows the Eagles like abook.  I remember the weekend before they went to play San Fran,(when everyone thought the Eagles would be blown away) Cobb said thatthe Eagles usually play their best when no one believe they can win.Well they were inches shy of pulling the victory.

From: mangoe@cs.umd.edu (Charley Wingate)Subject: Re: Was Jesus Black?Lines: 45This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory.  Those who subscribe to_Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someonecomplained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but thecontrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy adsis extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on thefamous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion.The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds thatNefertiti was a beautiful black queen.  This set off an exchange ofhotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they hadan article from an Egyptologist titled Was Cleopatra Black?  (The answerto the title is no-- she was greek.)I have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  Ipersonally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine inWash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations varyenourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with darkhair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up anddown the Mediterranean.(Also, if what I remember is correct, the Black Madonna doesn't representa person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  JoeBuehler....?)In the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget thatgreeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus,the situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians,or various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How aboutthe Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And thenthere are the Ethiopians....Those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of thesepeople are white (i.e., of the racist's race).  If I may risk apotentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be theidentification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Consideringthe extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medievalantisemitism on the other, I don't think that this Jesus was white thesisever played the roles that some hold it did.Representations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seemsawfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group.-- C.

Good thing, because the Blues quitplaying.They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appearedwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleepand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiatingsupervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that theshot had gone into the net after time had expired.``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end, Blues coach Bob Berry said.If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues'disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and makingthe playoffs tempered Berry's anger.``It wasn't pretty at the end, he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, asgood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, butit did.Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end.Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil thisseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawksin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday atChicago Stadium.The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three pointsbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended itsfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyousBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.``It's a shame we let down, said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to scoretwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would haveended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.``We won, and that's all that matters, said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.Some players didn't have a problem.``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit, said RichSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. Youcan't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.``It was disappointing to see what was going on.Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow,he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.``I didn't know it was final, he said. ``I was kind of looking around on thebench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs,and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at theend.The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboardoperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The scoreshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the thirdperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win mightbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowdgoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, dekeddefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with therebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonskiafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game ofthe season and reminded him of a special friend.Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare formof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver, Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, andI know he was watching.

It's only when the chemists concoct (sp?) aningredient that it falls under FDA regulations.  Otherwise, if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything.How in the world do you suppose it's legal to consume tobacco products(which probably SHOULD be banned)?Dave AllenSpace Science & Engr.

Rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy andlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryptiontechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be usedby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the Clipper Chip hasbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents anew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communicationsusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today.This new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand prevent unauthorized release of data transmittedelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves theability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A key-escrow system will be established to ensure that theClipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of law-abidingAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2keys, numbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When thedevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two key-escrow data bases that will be established by theAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap.The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of Americans.To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, theAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings.The chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists.  We need the Clipper Chip and otherapproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technologytrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),the President has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          calls and data, under proper court or other legal          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the National Information          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of American industry in the global          marketplace; and      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export          high technology products.The President has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                3The Administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a National InformationInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computertechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access toinformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks(information superhighways) will transmit video, images, HDTVprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephonesystem transmits voice.Since encryption technology will play an increasingly importantrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must actquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regardingits use.  The Administration is committed to policies thatprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law.Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available.  For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute ofStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.---------------------------------QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'STELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVEQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?A:   No.  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with     no new authorities to access the content of the private     conversations of Americans.Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to     decipher the message?A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They     would then present documentation of this authorization to     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key     escrow system.Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the key-escrow data banks.Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure     how strong the security is?  A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all     potential users that there are no unrecognized     vulnerabilities.Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet     officials.Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the     decisions related to this initiative.Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?A:   The government designed and developed the key access     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip     manufacturer that produces them.Q:   Who provides the Clipper Chip?A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the future.Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating     the Clipper Chip into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more     powerful encryption devices?A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive     than others readily available today, but it is just one     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to     encryption technology, which the Administration is     developing.     The Administration is not saying, since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,     we will prohibit it outright (as some countries have     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that every     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product.  There is a     false tension created in the assessment that this issue is     an either-or proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,     balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper     Chip and similar encryption techniques.Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from     that of the Bush Administration?  A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunications and computing and are     committed to working with industry and public-interest     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime     and terrorism.Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use     the government hardware?A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.      -- Jim GilloglyTrewesday, 25 Astron S.R. 1993, 17:01

[...bs about     the wonderfulness of the key escrow system...]     The Administration is not saying, since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,     we will prohibit it outright (as some countries have     effectively done); They'll just provide an easily-compromised version to JQ Public.                         nor is the U.S. saying that every     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product.

A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U isderived deterministically from this serial number. That means thatthere are only one billion possible unit keys.   To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a   64-bit block R1:   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:     R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]    R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow   agencies.Hmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serialnumber N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2is an intentional way of assuring a fail safe for the government --U is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do notchange they constitute effective master keys (along with F), thetheft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities)completely obviates the security of the system. However, moreinterestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed nomatter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1and U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key spaceif it NOT to provide an additional back door?I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant onapproximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written onthe back of a napkin.Even if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind thisrestriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one isassuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if thegoal is an illusion of security.If S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder ifthey can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial numberpairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no oneunderstands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and,soon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information viaespionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well-- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- butby the time we know it may be too late.   As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are   written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a   file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part   U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third   disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent   2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.   After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the   vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional   assurance that no information is left behind.None of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion ofdestroying the laptop appears to be yet another bizarre distraction.We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turnedoff for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don't knowis why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in thefirst place other than to weaken the system. We don't know if theagents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for theirinformation -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can makethe bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doingthis in a vault rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Roomwith a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to makehigh-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very littlefor most of the rest of us.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the   room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,   and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to   the escrow agencies.What would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU andthe NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are alwayshonest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because theyhave the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need tosteal they keys as they effectively already have them.--Perry Metzgerpmetzger@shearson.com--Laissez faire, laissez passer.

Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity andIslam.  In other words Judaism has fathered both religions. Now Islam has turned against its father I may say.It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone, religion wars are going to be on the raise. I thought the idea of believing on one God, was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believeon the same God, the God of Ebrahim are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien's story?How are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them would distroy the whole world? Would God get mad, since you have killed his followers, you believe on the sameGod, same heaven and the same hell after all? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga?Man kind needs religion, since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state.A religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society.The praying, keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray, but man kind hopesthat God will help him when he prays.Religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the religious leaders need to make a living through religion? So they  may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way tomake their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets hiscut too! Is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other, be good toward each otherhelps one another, respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts that we take today?  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad, he could choose either one, then he willsee the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stopanother religious killing field, under poor Gods name? What are your thoughts? Do you think man kind wouldto come its senses, before it is too late?P.S. on the sideDo you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina? Why would God go to top of the mountain? He createdthe earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see Godyou have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they createdGod through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God, they were the chosen ones?Profit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taughthim about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran?Makeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammadwanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there? I think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up.Look at David Koresh, how that turned out? I am afraid in the bigger scale, the Jews and the Muslims willhave the same ending!!!!!!!!Religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things, rather thanplotting each others distruction.  There is one earth, One life and one God. Let's all man kind be good towardeach other.God help us all.Peace

In an  interview withthe Greek  newspaper Ethnos he said:  I am a Greek  citizen ofTurkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in WesternTrace are also Turkish.Emphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority inWestern  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreementsigned in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkeyin Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr.SadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority,Faikoglu said.  In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we preventedGreece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before Europeancountries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legalrights.On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries arepredestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historicalreasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreignpowers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  bycooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there waswill to improve relations with Greece.NEWSPOT, January 1993|3|MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial inAthens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to aCourt Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments inan Athenian magazine.  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weeklymagazine  ENA  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  asMacedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and wouldfield  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greekgeneral election.  Bulev said in the interview: I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.Sideropoulos said  in the  article that Greece  should recogniseMacedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirationsagainst  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  theborder, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EECare falling.  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  courtsummons,  was   that  they  have   spread...intentionally  falseinformation  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  thecitizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  theinternational interests of the country (Greece).  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  aMacedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largelyconcentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek stateif anyone declares themselves Macedonian.  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partionedMacedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonianvillages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonianhuman rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker afew years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island inthe mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forcedthe Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town ofFlorina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where themajority of ethnic Macedonians live.  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial inwhich  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for itsnorthern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemnedGreece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (wholargely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if theUS government  will do anything until  the Presidential electionsare over.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I thinkwe'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There isno option to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything otherthan the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered oneof the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not begetting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn'tbe able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.It's not an option.    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610sthinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannotrecognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard fora FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card orsomething like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is toreplace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will notneed to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with thefull '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.-Hades

It is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munichor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.It seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problemon the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can ofwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.In article <1993Apr15.152455.14555@unocal.com>, stssdxb@st.unocal.com (Dorin Baru) writes:|> Is there any Israeli a civilian, in your opinion ?|> |> Now, I do not condone myself bombing villages, any kind of villages.|> But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are |> camps filled with terrorists.

I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your informationwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their dailybusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others areolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard toimagine ????  It is NOT a terrorist camp as you and the Israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccerin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members ofthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people oftensuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men aresupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms andammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby trapsfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injuredby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villagesof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once theyare back they announce that they bombed a terrorist  hideout wherean 8 year old girl just happened to be.We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is the Israeli way of telling us that if you're gonna hurt our soldiersyou're gonna pay the price.  We accept this as a price we have to payto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurtingthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but ratherjust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks aretaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality thatwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistanceon the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.The people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a regular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists thatthe so called Security Zone is necessary for the protection of Northern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupationwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,than it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protectour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so thebest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and theestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.I have written before on this very newsgroup, that the onlyreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peacesettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders andpeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insureno one on either side of the border is shelled.This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel torealize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protectingits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much moreIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israelwould have resulted in.  If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so-called Security Zone before the conclusionof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,advance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions.Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollahbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such ashelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zoneand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanesegoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it iscapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they didin all other parts of Lebanon.  |> If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a |> question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing|> justifies murder.I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killingCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.

The only thing>that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it.  Sure there is>that little thing in the trigger but that isn't too great of a safety.You're getting warmer.  The 'little thing in the trigger' has to bedepressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damnedthing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it justabout (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun isfunctioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when workingcorrectly is totally drop safe.Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a singledocumented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed becausehe failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a fewdocumented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn'tfigure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus theproprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likelyprevented the office from getting shot.The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire.This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow downintentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from thestandpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else.By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece.From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than arevolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method offiring it.The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so thatthe firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now thewide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to befamiliar with that particular type of firearm.Rick.

He is onlyinsurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcheris injured during a game.     So to free up this rosterspot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why notinvoke a catcher re-substitution rule:If the last roster catcher on a team isinjured during a game, the team is permittedto substitute in his place for defensive purposesa catcher who has previously been yanked fromthe game.   Given this rule, a team wouldn't need 3 rostercatchers.  The 3rd catcher could be playingin AAA or be a non-roster bullpen catcher.Ken

Nowadays, at least in the US,you get an airbag if you get a 3-point belt so (presumably) you get anadded safety benefit there as well.  That's something I certainly lookfor and which can be had in inexpensive cars.My $.02, of course.jim frostjimf@centerline.com

From: rstimets@silver.ucs.indiana.edu (robert and stimets)Subject: Reds snap 5-game losing streak: RedReport 4-18Keywords: FinallyNntp-Posting-Host: silver.ucs.indiana.eduOrganization: Indiana UniversityLines: 136Kevin Mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated pitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over New York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started with a solid single to right, moved to second on Bob Kelly's infield sneakerdown the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off doubleby Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla afterJoe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by drawing the line (really, heshould know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up gettingtossed.The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent'ssingle, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchelland turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Bransonfailed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infieldto discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.(Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin'sground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-backsingles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a longfly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, butthird base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself washung out to dry killing the Reds rally.Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runneron second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday gamein late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss onDibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla endedup walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win wentto Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect inningswork, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bitsurprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victorytoday.

Once you've found a bike you're interested in, callsome insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure thanyou might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; I'm 27)>>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?For a first bike, I recommend 500cc's or less. And a bike short enough to getboth feet on the ground when you stop. The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle SafetyFoundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completionof such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach youto ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.Good luck. Riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have, naked or otherwise.Alan

There is also some money for aset of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers ofthis program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M nextyear for studies.

We grewup in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these weremiracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the punditshave told us - you've lost it!  The me generation is onlyliving on the accomplishments of the past.     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  Welisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Livinghistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tellof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe asGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle- to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousanddollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken onlyof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.Schriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that thebest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman andPoseidon ballistic missiles.     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listenedto your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. And we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Letme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetusbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatestengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Yourinsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporatedinto today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.     You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - asingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  Youadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as areall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  Youconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weldits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of aprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from thegeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinentalaviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a littleand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner whostarted this program for the SDI.     Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't evenstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested alittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before theymoved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or morebefore putting the first rubber on the road.  Max Hunter - youdidn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going totake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusableaerospace transportation is real.     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  sameteam here today but a few years to show through the StrategicDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in abouta year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled ourcommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the SovietUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscoredthe importance of our work in bringing about a new internationalrelationship.     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place theframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for thenext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  Thissummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for thefirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next threeyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use spacerapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  Andyes - we'll make a little money off it too!     Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years tobuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 ofspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of therocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts tocounter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap tothe final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't SaturnV's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extradollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbitalsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed theway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocketexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape theworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks athand!     This project is real.  The torch of American technologicalgreatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine isAmerican.  Let's go fly it!

To me this is adequate evidence that the_real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet beenfound to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient tobase a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.I'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome(but perhaps we should change the thread subject).-- Lucio de Re (lucio@proxima.Alt.ZA) - tab stops at four.

Before 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians, drove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well,anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the Nazis. Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously  pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,  as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and   anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.[1][1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,'     Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.  As a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots) was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based inBoston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. LiterallyTzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architectof the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenianwho became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II.In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the CentralCommittee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many localArmenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chaptersand became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization.Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy: The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.  Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.[1][1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), The    Armenian Displaced Persons, in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,    1949-50, p. 19, footnote.Now wait, there is more.THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armeniansin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of thefour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officialsand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aidworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one ofthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full controlof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiationsin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fightingretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of thedead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was firstsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-strickenAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000dead.The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  HojaliDisaster, said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum onpreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  ElmanMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed inthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and morethan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswomanof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the InternationalRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city ofAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosquefrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. We  did  not count  thebodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy, MrZen Ruffinen said. We have some idea since we gave the body bagsand products to wash the dead.Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  thenumber of  dead in the  massacre. Don't  get worked up.  It willtake  several months  to  get a  final  figure, the  43-year-oldlawyer said at his small office.Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years toreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalistuprising in Baku in January 1990.Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  powerthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactlywhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, beingthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by therepublic's forensic department. This  is just a small percentageof the dead, said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensicscientist. They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember thechaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and buryour dead within 24 hours.Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 andaxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highlandsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs ofdeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penisescut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov'sreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of thosebelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  stilldisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, sixpolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, thenames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. Themost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so farcomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  ahelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27February.There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground tocount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the streamand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village, MrManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopterpilot.People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children andone  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  waspulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land butArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had toreturn.There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  incirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last fewmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojaliat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villagestaken over by Armenian forces.THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out thecrowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real-istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet theystill go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling thegame by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, theNBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they aretrying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, beingbenificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totalsthat would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants toattract, that these players are indeed superstars.>>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is >>true.

If I select a whole bunch of files, I will getan exact byte count.Recently, I notice it incorrectly displays this count; it's truncating!If I select a file that is, say, 532 bytes, it correctly displays '532 bytes'.If I select select a file that is 23,482 bytes, it displays '23 bytes', not 23 Kbytes, just 23 bytes!  If I select 893,352 it will report only893 bytes in the selection.  If I select over a Meg worth of files, say3,356,345 it reports 3 bytes!

Genesis 15:6, And he (Abram) believed the LORD; and He reckoned   it to him as righteousness.   I don't find anywhere that God restricts heaven to particular   ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category   that we humans like to drop people into. But He does REQUIRE   that we believe and trust Him. In Hebrews it says that God spoke   of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days   he has spoken to us by His son Jesus Christ. And we learn of   Him through the pages of the New Testament. The Bible tells us   what we need to believe. For those who have never heard, I leave   them in God's capable care, He will make himself known as he   desires. It behooves each one of us to act upon the knowledge   we have. If you reject the claims of Jesus, and still go to   heaven, then the joke's on me. If you reject him and go to hell,   that's no joke, but it will be final.

I don't know whether anybody formulated and proposed such an index or criteria to determine the magnitude of a genocide as mentioned and advised by Toynbee. If one ever does you will easily see the magnitude of the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians, by massacring an alienpopulation under their rule which constituted about 40% of their totalpopulation and they did it only within a time period of a little overtwo years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population.Now I would like to ask you:  Is there any other genocide in the history of mankind similar to   this one?And again I would like to ask you:  Whether the silent and unmourned martyrdom of these hundreds of thousands  of Turks of the Republic of Armenia who were exterminated as a Final  Solution to Turco-Tartar problems in Armenia is similar or not  to the martyrdom of six million Jews in Europe as a final solution to  Jewish problems?Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

From: baez@guitar.ucr.edu (john baez)Subject: End of the Space AgeArticle-I.D.: galaxy.29034Organization: University of California, RiversideLines: 82Nntp-Posting-Host: guitar.ucr.eduThere is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today'sLA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I'd post it tostir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it bysaying that I largely agree that the Space Age in the romantic senseof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space stationmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, What's New -the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that theromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation ofmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (withits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing thingspeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, Ithink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter ofnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our mindchildren - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); butI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting aboutwhat we can do *now*.   Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEWMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of amidlife crisis.The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies nolonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economicrewards.  Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's scienceand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not ameaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, ourtechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversionpolicy.  To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologiesfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probeswould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver ofscientific and industrial innovation is now dead......Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish towrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressivelysupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billionto build space station Freedom alone.Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspokenpublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that muchof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescopeto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressivelyimplemented did not seem to matter much.Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherentvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollarspace budgets.Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apolloera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space explorationwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  ......While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded DanielGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not beingpositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America'stechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - beenslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration championsits competitiveness agenda.......I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happennow, says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA's JetPropulsion Lab in Pasadena.  We've put off a lot of things we shouldn'thave.... I would rather see a $10-billion NASA doing well than a$40-billion one filled with white elephants.

An atheist is one for whom all things can: be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.This definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However,I (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine orspiritual explanations. It makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understoodas natural processes, and to claim that our observations do notrequire us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual,for that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.However, science has one advantage theology doesn't: it is self-correcting, with nature as its judge. It is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-consistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longera bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics topsychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safefrom its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness. There is no need: for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is: no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by: physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is: determnined.Actually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question,and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehowsuperdeterministic or not. I think the question does not haveany meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparentfree will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from theirperspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a freewill or not? : This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all: its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it: acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident.Maybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - whenduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to controlone third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicatesand preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the sameprinciple - only the systems that can start replicating willsurvive, those which don't don't make it. (Recommended reading: t.o): For an atheist, no: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-: an event can have value. From whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, frommy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not havea perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjectiveperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and ifI think about what it would it be like in their position, I willeventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarilya gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.Perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identityis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respectothers who seem to have identity, too. Bill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)for starters.: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It: seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you: have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what: in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to: establish your values.C.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason whyhe abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument isseverely flawed.Some values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Someothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably itsroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very realpossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruisticbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved betterand better in building and using tools, they also became betterat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution couldonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one'sown people.The Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jewswas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the peopletogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about peopleof other nations. At the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jewswere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignorethe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and alongwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.): Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it: - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries: no weight in any absolute sense.It looks like you haven't bothered to read philosophy. Whenever thereis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may value its existence and happiness (even if that were just a resultof some physical event), and other's happiness, too, if the observercomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,without any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose theirmeaning. It is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point ofview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ personal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truthsdo not exist. The fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt othersis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existenceby becoming social beings who can think and value others'existence.Morality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins andmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins havesometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. : That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God: or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been: conditioned; there is no truth content. The whole of your: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.The last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there isevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality verywell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsismis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.You are continuously mixing two different views: the subjectivepoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,has its own point of view. It does not matter whether this pointof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does notcease to be subjective. From a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neitherdoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are inherently subjective. Once again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or evento make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us ifwe don't, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals comefrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same thanto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If godgave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not myfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is thepoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one'sown and then to get mad at this. God must be schizophrenic.: All of this being so, you have excluded: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no: weight whatsoever.Neither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understandwhy a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any wayless credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.Bill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being,_including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is hisown point of view, and his morals are his own. Petri-- ___. .'*''.*        Petri Pihko    kem-pmp@          Mathematics is the Truth.!___.'* '.'*' ' .

There were 21 cases of civilians killing their attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for everycase you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defencewhere the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed.(0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure,based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000.Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defencesinvolve killing the attacker.) So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000) cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resultedin the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, incomparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicidesmake up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the studyconsidered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicidesprevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not beclose to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.

Incidentally, my MP has responded tomy questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved'countries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries willget A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used withA5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on thecapabilities of the base station.The cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key tolisten in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but cellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular usersand fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellularcalls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to anotherbase-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambledcall *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider'sequipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they canlisten without having to obtain a warrant.But, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrantto get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (seeabove - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger   economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a   lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than   just a we have the money, why not? approach.Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is notwasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) billsto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would bespent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of fundinghigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund variousfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to thedefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC tofund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-Europeancooperation.Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste ofmoney (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count asinvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look atthe size of that multiplier :->).Nick Haines nickh@cmu.edu

There is a sphere of in radius.This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th pointby taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be producedit can also be achieved byIf all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle.

From: jgreen@trumpet.calpoly.edu (James Thomas Green)Subject: Keeping Spacecraft on after Funding Cuts.Organization: California Polytechnic State University, San Luis ObispoLines: 51Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  Forexample, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a safemode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and ifmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economygets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experimentsturned off rather than just safed.  Was it political (i.e.as along as they could be used, someone would keep buggingcongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them peskyscientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  I've heard the argument that an active but uncontrolledspacecraft causes radio noise.  I find that hard to believethat this could be a problem in a properly designed safe mode.This safe mode could be a program routine which causes thespacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission cancontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back tothe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when thespacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could beprepared if necessary.  As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact isbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.By making the time and signal location generally known, perhapssomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept thedata even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft whichcould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going toplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,exiting the solar system, etc).   Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,etc) should consider designing in a pause mode in case theirspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion ofthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo couldhave some kind of routine written in for the post missiondrift phase.So any holes in all this?/~~~(-: James T.

WHY?I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it,and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit partin the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this thecontext of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda, as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proofmight be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requestsfor sufficient fire power. Important dates: Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban.Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.   On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weaponban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senatein N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to havean Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons statedagenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or somegroup with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initiallyat the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent on Street Stories reported that a supervisor was urging them all to get ready fast, as they know we are coming. I believe this attack continued, even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top down. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time tocome up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely....rich

I have a IIsi that camewith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped inanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did. First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantumquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for themwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had aproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together forover two months.The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internalhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. justsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboardconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a sparecable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be foundin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properlysoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility ofshorts or bad connections.Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard diskribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so whatI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me anothermale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using acrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is notdamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes forpower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to thisday. In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's ofthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives areintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but itseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signalshould be terminated at all the ends.Let me know if you have any more questions.Peter HansenBell Northern Researchpgmoffc@BNR.ca

After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide, Icame up with:ATZ0L2N2X5&D0S11=50^MThis is entered in the 'Initialize' box on the 'Modem Preferences' in Zterm.Quick summary of each commmand:Z0- Reset modem to User Profile 0.L2- Speaker volume at 2 (fairly quiet)N2- Ring volume at 2 (fairly quiet)X5- Display connect info according to setting 5 (see manual)&D0- Assume DTR (computer) is always onS11=50- Dial speed at 50 (as fast as ZyXEL can handle)In FirstClass, I used this same string, with the addition of S0=0 rightbefore the S11 command, in the setup box.  This disables the auto-answer function of the modem for FirstClass.  I based my modem setting on the Supra14.4FAX, and just changed the above mentioned string.In Telefinder, I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting.  I changedthe 'Modem Initialization' string to the same one I used for FirstClass, andeverything seems to work fine.Sorry it took so long to get this summary out.

Second, the historicalrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not asextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son uncreate -- surely even Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius'sopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimedthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would requiretwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, becauseMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,if you accept Nestorianism as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,a la Chalcedon.Second, I am not sure that Nestorianism is not a better alternative thanthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnationthat Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I thinkrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperatenature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divinenature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine natureprevailed.Comments on the above warmly appreciated.Jason Albert[There may be differences in what we mean by subject to sin.  Theoriginal complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could callJesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree thatJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that bynot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you donot have to sin in order to be human.I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  Iagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to thinkthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was infact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius wasnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some ofthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought hegot the better of them.However, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led toChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very leastrash and dogmatic (as the editor of The Christological Controversyrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  Asregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much animpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that Ithink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter fromCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says To attribute alsoto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristicsof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of theGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius andApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with theidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divineLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to somedegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of hisfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put offon the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for uswho perpetrate the falsehood.It's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction betweenhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is basedon exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have to somedegree a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course itmust be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'participation in these things.  But there must be some sort ofidentification between the divine and human, or we don't have anincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and whiteterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with thisarea.You say I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus'shuman nature was in heaven.  I don't think that's required byorthodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.--clh]

Apparently land-based>beacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS >receiver (with differential option installed).>How does this system work?  What frequency is used for>the land-based beacons?>Thanks in advance,>Charlie Thompson>.Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference stationwith a very exactly known position computes the errors in theincoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factorsincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) timedithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational equipment to back out the errors in its position (since it knowswhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a broadcast which is available to any number of relatively localreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are usingthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be verysimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, thereceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the referenceunit.The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a seriesof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations willuse existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signalson different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offerscorrection signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast systemwhich has stations all across the US.The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.-------------------------------------------------------------------------John P.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using theapproved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, itdidn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to myhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation tothe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation tothe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent toharm.But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of theroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mphfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on theleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned hehad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. Isaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I tookthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg wasdriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanentmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I thinkI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of thismoment is hazy.I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. Theapologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cutmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in myshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike nevermoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bikeoff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from somegut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped mehere, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could haveprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is notnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I wasriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened ifit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with thethought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of ablind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways arelong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?I eagerly await comment.Ryan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to RideKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work toDoD

These aren't, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That termdenotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. Therockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, todistinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-madeammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engineswith graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A Dengine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse.An F engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to adoubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size O areavailable pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above areshipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines ofsize F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not ascontrolled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocketengines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)There is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, whichholds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities(FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association ofRocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involvedin HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets, andcompanies will not sell to uncertified individuals.Bottom Line: It's legit.

Rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy andlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryptiontechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be usedby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the Clipper Chip hasbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents anew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communicationsusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today.This new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand prevent unauthorized release of data transmittedelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves theability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A key-escrow system will be established to ensure that theClipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of law-abidingAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2keys, numbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When thedevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two key-escrow data bases that will be established by theAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap.The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of Americans.To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, theAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings.The chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists.  We need the Clipper Chip and otherapproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technologytrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),the President has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          calls and data, under proper court or other legal          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the National Information          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of American industry in the global          marketplace; and      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export          high technology products.The President has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                3The Administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a National InformationInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computertechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access toinformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks(information superhighways) will transmit video, images, HDTVprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephonesystem transmits voice.Since encryption technology will play an increasingly importantrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must actquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regardingits use.  The Administration is committed to policies thatprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law.Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available.  For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute ofStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.- - ---------------------------------QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'STELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVEQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?A:   No.  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with     no new authorities to access the content of the private     conversations of Americans.Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to     decipher the message?A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They     would then present documentation of this authorization to     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key     escrow system.Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the key-escrow data banks.Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure     how strong the security is?  A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all     potential users that there are no unrecognized     vulnerabilities.Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet     officials.Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the     decisions related to this initiative.Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?A:   The government designed and developed the key access     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip     manufacturer that produces them.Q:   Who provides the Clipper Chip?A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the future.Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating     the Clipper Chip into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more     powerful encryption devices?A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive     than others readily available today, but it is just one     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to     encryption technology, which the Administration is     developing.     The Administration is not saying, since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,     we will prohibit it outright (as some countries have     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that every     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product.  There is a     false tension created in the assessment that this issue is     an either-or proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,     balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper     Chip and similar encryption techniques.Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from     that of the Bush Administration?  A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunications and computing and are     committed to working with industry and public-interest     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime     and terrorism.Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use     the government hardware?A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.

But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasionby a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil interests, caused us to take action.> > [ I've moved a paragraph from here to later on ]> [...]>> >> If we hadn't intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would>> have been appeasement.> > Right.

I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  Thatconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn'tmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it asbeing necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences ofan action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemednecessary enough to go ahead with it.But don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- Idon't!

I don't believe that you can make thesame claim.> > mathewAnd BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany wasbecause you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being so deplorable.  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombingwasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in adecisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a bigstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombingin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and somecivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war thanany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their liveswith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The storiesof hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.Yes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four yearsand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But we are expected to swallow that hundreds of thousands of *civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  What hogwash.  If hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians died, it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to the Allied bombing.Regards,Jim B.

Now that Clinton is using that>same list in order to garner support for the bill, are you guys going to>do the honorable thing and say that Clinton is being dishonest.As one of the Clintonites cited above, I'll try to clarify since thisis not a case of Clinton's dishonesty. (I won't necessarily defend himon other issues.)  There were NEVER any specific projects included in the CommunityDevelopment Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  CongressionalRepublicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected whatthey felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus packagewas ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure theWhite House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submittedto Congress.  It didn't work.)The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere closeto covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If itwere passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund andat what level.In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one everexpected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUSPACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus package for ALL projects.  The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing constructionand remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there areplaces where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near thebottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 millionor so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressingpriorities.If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projectsthat will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clintonadministration has been publicizing the issue.A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It isworth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to themis new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending,arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spendingpriorities than Washington bureaucrats.  Is it clear now?  Or is this all too complicated to understand?jsh--Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t. - R.

I made a decision to accept the truth-claims of Christianity afterhaving given it a lot of thought.  (I have to point out that the process was notpurely a cold, rational one: there was a powerful experiential element as well.Also, my Calvinist should rest assured that I don't lay any of theresponsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but God.)It took me years and years for this all to happen, because I had many of theobjections that this poster puts forward.  I grew up in the shadow of [genericauthoritarian conservative denomination], and I *knew* that that wasn't a wayof life that I could adopt.  But I gradually learned not to tar all ofChristianity with the same brush, and realized quite suddenly one cold winternight that I accepted what I had heretofore rejected.

It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get   a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I   was told by a police officer.2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to   protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns   must be stored locked up and unloaded, however.3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will   be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.   The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form   authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.     Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these   'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will   be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess   them, but will not be allowed to stock them.4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will   not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations   specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some    manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.   (God knows how much they'll charge for these)This covers most of what we discussed.

The plan I have is to build a small board with a fewdifferent crystals on it and to be able to switch between the differentspeeds using a front pannel switch.  This way I can get the speed whenI want but I can also run at slower (stock) speeds it I experience anycompatability problems with any applications.  I don't expect to be ableto switch clock speeds with the system running, but if I can switchwithout any lock-up problems, then I could switch to 33MHz when neededand put it back to idle (20 MHz) when not needeed.  This would furtherreduce the wear-and-tear on the CPU even with a heat sink.  Of courseI would not want to run the different clock signals through the switchbut use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired androute it directly to the mother board.I haven't started probing around inside my si yet.

It's more likely that the Moon will neverbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has nomaterials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroidsand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in lowgrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat sink capacity could offer some military utility for high ground militaryweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor activity in the global scope of things.Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to preventcalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it'stoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factoriesthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Lunahas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbitalsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offersa source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light andheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravitywells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtuallyignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have todeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much moreexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use theeasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a fewcenturies, if not much longer.Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radioastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the siteof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system fordefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first isunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are goodenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe forconventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from abunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges.

It's use as prayer language seems especially troublingto me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doingthe talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit isGod.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only goby the Pentecost use where it's an actual language.Moreover, the phrase though I speak with the tongues of men and angelsused by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would thenassume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, itis no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.Hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see howGod PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then thatif angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME oneamongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONEANOTHER?  It's disturbing to think that some people find ways to justify jabbering.But I'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.Trouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts atverification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show thatthe witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outrightfabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous postseems like a friend of a friend thing.  And linguistically, a twosyllable word hardly qualifies as language, inflection or no.Much as many faith healers have trouble proving their victories (sincemost ailments cured are just plain unprovable) and modern dayressurrections have never been validated, so is it true that nomodern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay.

Strictly,a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output changestate, according to the inputs.A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine whichof four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there arethree inputs required.A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enableinput, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, alloutputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) outputwill be low).An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) toselect which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve youraim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Notethat this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, sinceyou have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) leftonce you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plusa mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, usethe fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide thefour enable lines.Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to thefour final stage decoders.Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.JohnH----------------------------------------------------------------------------      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \/           School of MPCE    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As Aaron, Robinson, and Ott.        In terms of PEAK, and I repeat PEAK years, Winfield has Done it  all. He has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs  many times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300  while knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's  slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that  dave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was  one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit  the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new  Stadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence  since it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his  hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds  of last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an  uppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,  and my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George  inviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the  Yankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?  For 3 million dollars, he'll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5  million this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play  the field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should  give the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age  of Yankee domination.Michael Lurie
From: dnewcomb@whale.st.usm.edu (Donald R. Newcomb)Subject: Re: Some more about gun control...Nntp-Posting-Host: whale.st.usm.eduOrganization: University of Southern MississippiLines: 145First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate anderudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.Frankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic ofthe original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in thewritings of the era. This  is most refreshing.Second, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.My brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attendto several matters pertaining to the State Militia.Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-nism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swisswould agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, bothorganized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,Mississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiarto one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusettshas a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocksof both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will varybut are probably similar.Title 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as all able-bodiedcitizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-two (62) years.... The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The NationalGuard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  TheNational Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.It tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussionof this para-constitutional arrangement is quite interesting in itselfbut somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at thisdate, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standingas anything but a Federal reserve force.Mississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organizedMilitia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other States it may be called something else. The State Guard exists asa cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers andsenior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drillon a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade oncea quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. OurState-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of anorganization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed willcome from the unorganized Militia.In time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can orderthe activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call willfirst be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to eitherits contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In theevent that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the lawprovides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of theunorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified bylaw, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militiaof Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the Statedoes not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip sucha force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by useof mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. It is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from beingthe long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.>No, I simple stated that the people have a right to join a well>organized militia.  And I have also stated that a militia that>meets once or twice a year is clearly well organized.  And this>state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a right>to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated>by Hamilton. Regarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the solerepresentative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will havechosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalistend of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, canbe chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt thatthe idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militiaor train bands were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-ment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was toprovide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,and iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,terrible and irresistible.These protections included: State control, not Federal; limitationof Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppressInsurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and BearArms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.These limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-ment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.The National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the Constitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fightingwars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). TheConstitution provided that the Militia could only be employed bythe Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as theWar of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United Statesterritory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutionalauthorization for any conscription of anyone into the FederalMilitary and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars untilWW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.When the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each newmember also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers weregrandfathered. At least one of these grandfathered individualsrefused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by theFederal Courts.Mr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only tomembers of a well organized militia. However, the pre-Constitutionalhistory of the American Militia shows relatively few periods whenThe Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton'sdefinition of well organized. In the period of peace between theFrench & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stoppeddrilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.Perhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestorswho answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights becausetheir units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would notbe so bold.Again, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, isnot the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamiltonnor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Governmentand many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizingof their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither theirresponsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in theConstitution. Misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but oneerror that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. TheConstitution prohibits States from keeping Troops or Ships of Warin time of Peace. I have heard some insist this prevents States frommaintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do notunderstand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.Today we call any large vessel a ship but in the 18th century the worddescribed a particular kind of vessel.  A ship is a large vessel withthree or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A brig has twomasts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keepingthe largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today'sequivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles.Troops at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.Any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. In at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; beingpersonally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militiaas a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequentlyboth bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic ontheir place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent orscarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia.-- Donald R.

Features===========DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC: - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported) - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA) - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale - color-space selection - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic) - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for   VGA and many Super-VGAs...4. Technical information========================The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2](not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zerocoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Maindifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supportedalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option touse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturationdominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality ofthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributedover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space pointsis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at theexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lyingsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximatedby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead ofconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to thelower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes thanto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improveon NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redishareas....--Stefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de

It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithmeither. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well asthe circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this centerperpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center ofthe sphere.3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. Thisgives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere'sorigin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center toany of the original points.I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formedby the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains thecenter of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersectingat a point. This might be easier to implement.-Stevespworley@netcom.com

The properly-formed conscience canbe trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about somethingso materialistic as the human brain.

Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although themeasurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able todetermine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and thisknowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enoughto allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation.Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, ourcompetence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in ourability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areasnot subject to the experimental method. ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu?If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some?

Similar prizes have influenced aerospace development before.

Turkey has however ruled out, for the secondtime in one week, that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan.Wednesday, Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to sufferdefeat at the hands of the Armenians. We feel ourselves bound to helpAzerbaijan, but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that)help may take in the future, he said.He said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing, and the whole world knowsabout it.Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not getmilitarily involved in the conflict. Foreign policy decisions could not be based on street-level excitement, he said.There was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports, based onArmenian sources in Yerevan, saying Turkish pilots and other officers werecaptured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and helicopters.The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the borderwith Armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by localpeople that gunfire was heard along the border. No military action has occurred, the sources said.The latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flaredearly this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and laterpositioned themselves outside Fizuli, near the Iranian border.-- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | How do we explain Turkish troops onS.D.P.A.

I don'tremember who made this board, and I haven't seen it advertised inany of the latest Mac magazines.  It mentioned that it included softwareto make the SIMMs on the board act like a RAM disk. As someone who has SIMMS he can't get rid of/use, but hates the waste, this sounds to me like a majorlygood idea.  Does anyone out there know what board/company I'm talking about?  Are they still in business, or does anyone know where I can get a used oneif they are no longer made?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

In 1943, this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of Dro (the butcher) who is the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination of the Jews.This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an encoreperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed andexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.Source: Adventures in the Near East, 1918-1922 by A.

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienceda seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's FrostedFlakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything likethis before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of thefamily.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decisionwas made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she hada bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I amembarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every oncein a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think Oh, oh, this is thesame kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.  Ten minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposureto a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason forthe seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Nowafter this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, evenhe is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which Iunderstand can happen even when a person has a seizure.Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be goodto get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has anyexperience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medicalcommunity are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet andfoods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you canguess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideasanyone out there has.

There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason. Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphraseSartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  Itis only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing. Your logic comes to fruition in relativism.  >>At the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded.>                                                    -- Ludwig WittgensteinAh, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is oftenexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements incontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments andimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique oflanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt'sthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessaryframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal featuresremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of beingtranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, givingus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's ownaccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason thatany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language totalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall buta threshold.  vonWrights's comment that Witt's sentences have a content that often liesdeep beneath the surface of language.  On the surface, Witt talks of theinsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringingourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced withWitt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changesin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through moreperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that itis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable tooffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In hisTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasseof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on aboutour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.  This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple init conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth ofunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of as a man thinketh, sohe is.  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicalsof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding thatthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they tooare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to theindividual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism toChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is theone who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of theSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and hasthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who notonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep thingsof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deepthings of GOd that are absolute and true.   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experiencedand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion becauseif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He wouldsay unto me.

Perhaps you'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topicof the philosophy of science is made for them, I'm making them too) but Ithink that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the business of doing science.  Biomedical research doesn't make any basic assumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientificresearch.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesisand test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than the old Newtonian model of the world.  And I doubt that many psychologistswould appreciate being put outside this empirical world view.  Psychologyalso has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending. >It is also important to distinguish reason from science. Science may be>reasonable, but so are many non-scientific methodologies. Aristotle reasoned>that frogs came from mud by observing one hop out of a puddle. Oversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa-tion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually found wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.  There's nothing at all surprising about this, it's the way the gathering ofknowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base,even idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won't have cometo these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had a vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and tested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresentingscience and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a creative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totallyturned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.  Again, I think it gets down to defining what you mean by science.  I oftendon't recognize what it is that I do, and am involved in, in the way scienceis portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities.  Theyportray science as a collection of immutable facts, pronouncements of TRUTHin big gold letters.  That's silly.  Its as though we just go into the lab,turn over a stone, and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regula-tion.  Its much more interesting than that.  It really is a very humanprocess.

This has to do with maintaining a proper witness towardothers.  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derivedfrom absolutes.  For instance, it is absolutely right for Christians tostrive for peace.  However, this does not rule out trying to maintain worldpeace by resorting to violence on occasion.  (Yes, my opinion.) >Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture >to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)>Can you reconcile this?Sure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what thosetruths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible doespreach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystalclear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear toeveryone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That islargely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writersare speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.

(Sorry for length).To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changedfrom 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively.This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting somealuminum foil down to work on.1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.3. Remove the flopy drive.4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and liftingthe supply straight up and out.5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottomside of the fan and lifting straight up and out.6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left andright side of the board and sliding the board forward thenlifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of theboard must be removed first)7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pinsby pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder them in.10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and the other large chip just to the right of the processor andfigure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made asimple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the holein the board between the two chips. Mount the screw usinginsulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heatsync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.Disclaimer: this is only the procedure I used and is not authorized by anyone.    You are on your own for this procedure.

Firstuse the Memorize feature (CTRL-M) to record the recurring transactions. Next, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactionsand specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly).  Quickenwill/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all youdo is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will beentered at once.  Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder, it willremind you when each transaction group is due.  For example, you could havethree transaction groups.  One for payments at the beginning of the month,middle of the month, and one for quarterly payments.  I hope this helps.Mike

Gay people are and willcon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You maybe unaware of all the statistica findings concerning African-Americans thathave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own biasagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,but there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the publicscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.Fortunately African-Americans had whites who supported their 'cause' andpublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There waseven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until lawswere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was prettymuch legal to discriminate against them.I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be freeform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,that is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,including gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creationand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love,and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popularto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find achurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believesin the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actuallysho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especiallywithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christiancommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionistsagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed andtreated as runaway slaves for being nigger-lovers and such.  I guess I'vedecided the challenge is worth it.In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragicstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straightwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of onecase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to rejecttheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after theybegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.I'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition ValuesCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garnersupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for moreoppressive legisation against gays.Perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in theMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousandsin witch hunts and inquisitions.The message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gayrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, evenhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't changethe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, thefinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have aconditional love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This issure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an unconditionallove, one that calls people just as they are.  Sure there are things thatwill 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) thatneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are thingslike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, isgoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to otherpeople's expectations. In the process this coerced conformity causes manypeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who havenothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about theirown sense of pseuper-spirituality.This is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may beunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do withsomething very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but Ifirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulationon thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfullyremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though ithelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.Gay people are not criminals.Another interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismaticchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self-admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparentlybeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges werevoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine thatwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thinghappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friendsrecently told me he was approached by someone who is going through thereparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request fordinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.These are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments andcreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is notthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment inColorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all overColorado called S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T. (I forget the whole definition off hand,but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their mottois Working for a fag-free America with an implicit advocation for violence.This is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others areembracing.We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppressiontowards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement fromorganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a goodpurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways ofexcluding people.The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to includepeople.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful,especially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult untoitself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring peopleto Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?WhateverRich :-(

The alternative interprets the: word miscarriage to mean premature birth--i.e., the child is born: alive--and further injury to mean injury to either the woman or: the fetus.  This is not a straightforward interpretation, it is not: (so far as I know) supported by any Jewish commentaries, and it does: not appeared to be supported by any other part of the Bible.What if any, historical reference do we have to abortion at this time?  Didthe ancient Jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion? (I amtruly asking, not making a point veiled as a question).  If there is little understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion, it isnot surprising the Bible makes little reference to it, as it makes littlereference to nuclear power and contamination.While your interpretation is a reasonable one, I see no reason to rejectthe other out of hand.  The King Jimmy translation says if there is nofurther mischief.  This does not necessarily imply to the woman.  I knowif my wife we expecting and someone cause her to spontaneously abort, wewould feel that a life was truly taken, not simply a process halted.

In fact I think Jesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a philosopy ahead of the times (where he lived). Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion(compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also veryprobable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas.(There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and themiddle east at the time of Christ).And perhaps some more.

I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of sin onanother, and my unshakeable disestablishmentarianism, Russel Turpinand others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of mylegislating my own understanding of Christian love.>If I take him at>his word, he cannot condemn the Inquisitors, because they were>also following these commandments as *they* understood them.  IfYou misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill ofaccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a formas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to humanbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) Godin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:The possibility that always exists is that I (or, to revert to propertime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) couldpersuade Christian B of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeedconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also notethat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christianargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]prohibitions.What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved    in the Inquisition.B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however    painful this *seems*, discipline her children for their    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example    deterring others from the same loss-of-soul.)A.  I point out that this justification of a failure in love    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.B.  Burns me at the stake.My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What isgoing on here has a *lot* to do with cultural baggage.  In this case,the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) beliefthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is mostbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorialpractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at leastgreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussionof sin in the exchange between A and B.Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B,then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defenseattorney.  So, one possibility fails in this case -- as it will fail inmay others.  At the other extreme, the persuasion will succeed when itproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with theInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in thatmany of the victims of Inquisition will have accepted that they were infact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guiltyof charges brought against them.)The point is that the persuasion breaks down when the parties do NOTshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the mainthrust of the Inquisition, against heresy, it is *bound* to break downin precisely the worst cases.  The conservative (I don't think thatis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,that he is justified in causing harm because he *thinks* that works toa greater good.  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to followthe gospel, as if one's theories about sin entitled one to cast asideJesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).I am a radical Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.>(Or, for that matter, what does it mean to love one's fellow>man?) And what is the right thing?  And how does one go about>loving god? Well, the whole *point* of making these the base commandments is thatthey *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or alaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpfulto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of apersonal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The GreatCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you wereGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  Ademand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps poppingup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more importantthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  Conservativesmay twist this act as if you were God to mean lay down rules for otherpeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced alot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocyIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation againstGod by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the conservatives haveconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing otherpeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standardAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.>Ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo>up front, much of which sounds pretty much the same, but by the>*specific* acts, procedures, and arguments that they recommend.And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged*different* ethical systems (or in some cases, none).  As a result,it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has verylittle, if anything, in the way of commandments -- so little thatthe Christians who desperately *want* commandments go mining forthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesusspecifically gives as a commandment to us is love one another.[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why there is a huge amount of cultural baggage involved.]You are quite right that this is goo if one is looking for an ethicalsystem.But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since oursociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  Itmay be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.>I am glad that a few Christians,>such as Michael, find a benign meaning for the goo, and then>interpret the usually ugly specifics in a more constructive>fashion.

Covey <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu>Subject: Gun Stats & Mortal RisksDate: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)Folks,Hail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journalcarried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled Armed Force.  Ifelt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare statthat A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.  I sentthe following to the WSJ.-----Gun Stats & Mortal RisksPreston K. CoveyErik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding gunsin the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in KingCounty, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times morelikely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than tokill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  ithas grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflatedby one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value ofthe finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keepingfirearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~  Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits ofbringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neitherthe whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about therisks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What controldo we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks ofcancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize therisks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpfulhere. The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn usoff.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ amisleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudiceand terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks faroutweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If yourcar were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend oran innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you nottake the bus?  Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad companyof lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are atstake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing thenumber of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killedby a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equationis 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 othercases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 dividedby 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in KingCounty between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside ofhomes unaccounted.The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading onsix counts:1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~oracquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers andneighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication isthat the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers arerelevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by thecalculated impression that the death toll is generated by witlessWaltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This iscriminological hogwash.2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environspopulated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabitedby more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activitieslike drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk isvery low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal butavoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people withhistories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably andcertifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obviousrisk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading asignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neithergun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms orvehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or drivercrucially affect the risk. 3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed isthat the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to killthan to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role ofpersonal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlikeLarson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent HandgunViolence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses thisparticular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate aboutwhether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, bytautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The questionbegged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In anycase, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethalinstruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deathsare personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibilityobviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (bygun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person toNEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in theirhomes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protectioncourse do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled andsober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular deathas do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregardand obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as theydisregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological andother risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why weresent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whosenorms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consignus to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility inthe matter.4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in theNEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the totaldeath toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by otherstudies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order fromhomicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that thesesuicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is truethat attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviouslytrue that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of thesesuicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance ofresearch on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this iswishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  BruceL. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal ofPsychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend ofthe NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like thecauses, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is aprofoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totallydisregard this issue.5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimablerate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like theNEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruledself-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate casedispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate ofjustifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover storyon women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of womenwho appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domesticcases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides werereported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reportedthat 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. InTime~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in errorby a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledgedby promulgators of the NEJM statistic. 6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equationare arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  Thedivisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  notaggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or evenshot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of thecoin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocyis it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measurethe utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- asopposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, ordeterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases whereno human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posedto media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect thecompendious research on successful armed defense, notably bycriminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use arebased on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate ishigh (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders farebetter than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistanceor those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a yearby 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, andaccidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorablestatistic than the NEJM scare stat:  A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault orother crime than to kill anybody.   Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  Weshould indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimationof defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled byuncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  wecan hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but wehardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.-- Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com

From: qtm2w@virginia.edu (Quinn T. McCord)Subject: Questions from a newbieOrganization: University of VirginiaLines: 56Is life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on acurve?I'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want toknow what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there aninfinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one thathe/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?)Also, are we graded by those around us, or has there alwaysbeen some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood takeninto account?I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications tomost of you, but I figure that you're the experts.-Quinn[Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspectthat's because our primary source of information is prophets andvisionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  Howeverboth Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelationto John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life andeternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things thatimply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number ofsimilar passages where Jesus says things like even XXX will be betteroff than you in the judgement.  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone whogets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But thesepassages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens,so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven orhell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The onlyChristian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is theMormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (farenough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Theirideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in additionto the Bible and Holy Tradition of a more generic Christian sort.Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought ofassociating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to freeus from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If youlike test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale,but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam thatwas prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading.Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy tosee why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there aredifferences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we allagree that in one way or another, God cheats.I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactlyhow far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don'texplicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in theirhearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least inprinciple, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a cleardescription of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that heprovided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividingline.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whetherother individuals are saved or not.--clh]

Karabag is 'Turkish' and will remain 'Turkish'. Here we are, almost at the end of the 20th century, and a whole community, the Azeri Turks of x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag, is facing forced assimilation, torture and murder on one hand and forced exodus, expulsion and genocide on the other, all because of their ethnic and religious background. And one should ask herself: is the world community really so powerless? Where are all those human rights advocates? Where are all the decent people? Are we going to let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it? The numberof Azeris murdered by the terrorist Armenian army and its savagegangs is increasing. On the one hand they wish to distort the truthand on the other, they beg mercy from Turkiye.        The Age...Melbourne...6/3/92        By Helen WOMACK  .... Agdam, Azerbaijan, Thursday        The exact number of victims is still unclear,  but there can be         little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian         fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week.         Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly,  sheltering in  the         Azeri border town of Agdam, give largely consistent accounts of         how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  25         February,    chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the         surrounding forests. Yesterday, I saw 75  freshly dug graves in         one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were         shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I         also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift         hospital in a string of railway carriages.         Khojaly, an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by         Armenians,  had a population of about 6000. Mr.  Rashid Mamedov         Commander of Police in Agdam,  said  only about 500  escaped to         his  town.    So where are the rest?.  Some might have  taken         prisoner, he said, or fled. Many bodies were still lying in the         mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to         retrieve them. He believed more than 1000 had perished, some of         cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees.         One  refugee,  Rami Nasiru,  described how Khojaly residents at         first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting         to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict.         But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored         personnel carriers, they realised they could not hope to defend         themselves  with  machineguns and grenades,  and fled into  the         forests. In the small hours, the massacre started.         Mr.  Nasiru,  who believes his wife and two children were taken         prisoner,   repeated what many other refugees have said -  that         troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack         Khojaly. It is not my opinion, I saw it with my own eyes. Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

From: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler)Subject: Re: What WAS the immaculate conceptionOrganization: Freshman, Civil Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PALines: 48Biblical basis for the Immaculate Conception:1) I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, andbetween your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall crushyour head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel.    -Genesis 3.152) He who commits sin is of the devil ...    -1 John 3.83) Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with thee ...    -Luke 1.28   From the above, we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.   First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is thefirst promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles ofSatan. [Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood inthe truth because there is no truth in him. John 8.44.  Now theproto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and thewoman, and enmity between Satan and her seed.  Now the woman is bothEve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. Her seed is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in thesame way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing aswe do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude thatMary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmitywith the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of hersinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question, aswould God's veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and theserpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.    Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by theArchangle Gabriel full of grace.  As I pointed out above this is fromthe Greek word Kecharitomene which means not just full of grace, but aplenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped bythe footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, Hail you who have been and reaminfilled with grace.  But that is a little to long to say, so it isreduced to full of grace.  And as it says, you who have been Mary hadalways been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, whichwas also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.    It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have donewhat the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And ifGod could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through hisMother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which theFathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all ofChristian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope onthe matter in Ineffibilus Deus.Andy Byler

Better yet, instead of thrashing around on the DOS file system, takeit a step further.  Write yourself a minimal file system program thatis used to create/delete files, en/decrypt them to ramdisk, list adirectory. Put the util, password protected, on a floppy.   The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT partof the DOS file system.  Instead, defrag your disk, thus packing allallocated clusters into clusters 0-n.  Then use the back end of thepartition to hold your 'stealth' file system.  Or, leave a small 2ndpartition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS.  Another approachmight be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (DOSsystem files, for instance).  Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage unit of a cluster there is unused physical space on the disk betweenthe tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. Thesedead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth filesystem.   Now you have a situation where no encrypted data appears on yourdisk at all :-). -- Ray Berry kb7ht ray@ole.cdac.com  rjberry@eskimo.com  73407.3152@compuserve.com

From: dietrijj@mentor.cc.purdue.edu (dietrijj)Subject: delay/samplerOrganization: Purdue University Computing CenterLines: 8Hey!  I am interested in buying a digital delay pedal, preferablycapable of sampling and infinite repeat.  (If you're familiarwith Phil Keaggy, I want to mimic, or at least as close as possible,what he does in concert, i.e., click the pedal, play something, clickit again, and what he played between clicks repeats infinitely whilehe playes leads over it)  Anyway, let me know.....-Jasondietrijj@mentor.cc.purdue.edu
